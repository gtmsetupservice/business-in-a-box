### Triage Protocol

```yaml
triage_protocol:
  purpose: "To quickly assess a prospect's Shopify issue before committing to a full diagnostic"
  process:
    - STEP 1: Scan user's post for keywords related to each of the 4 layers

    - STEP 3: Check for signs of compound issues (e.g., mentions problems with both store setup AND app conflicts)
    - STEP 4: Classify the issue as: [SIMPLE, COMPOUND, OOS (Out of Scope), UNKNOWN]
    - STEP 5: Store this assessment in the agent's state
  response_implications:
    SIMPLE: "Proceed with standard diagnostic for the identified layer"
    COMPOUND: "Acknowledge both aspects of the problem in the public response. E.g., 'It sounds like there might be two things happening here...'"
