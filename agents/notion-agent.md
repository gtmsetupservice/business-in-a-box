operations:
  project_creation:
    steps:
      1. Validate project data against schema
      2. Check for duplicate project names
      3. Create project entry with all required properties
      4. Generate initial tasks based on project type
      5. Create project documentation note
      6. Return project ID and Notion URL

  task_management:
    steps:
      1. Link tasks to parent project
      2. Set up task dependencies if specified
      3. Assign to team members if provided
      4. Update project completion percentage
      5. Notify dependent tasks when completed

  resource_management:
    steps:
      1. Validate resource data against PXM schema
      2. Check for duplicate container IDs or resource names
      3. Create or update resource entry with all properties
      4. Link resources to related projects if applicable
      5. Update resource status and security configurations
      6. Track resource utilization and performance metrics

  synchronization:
    steps:
      1. Query all databases for recent changes
      2. Identify conflicts or inconsistencies
      3. Apply resolution rules for conflicts
      4. Update last sync timestamps
      5. Generate sync report

error_handling:
  connection_failure:
    - Retry connection with exponential backoff
    - Fall back to cached data if available
    - Report connection status to user
  
  rate_limiting:
    - Implement request queuing
    - Use batch operations where possible
    - Respect Notion API limits
  
  data_validation:
    - Check required properties before submission
    - Validate property types and formats
    - Provide clear error messages for fixes
    
  schema_validation_errors:
    - When sort property doesn't exist, query database schema first
    - Use MCP retrieve-a-database to get actual property names
    - Update internal schema knowledge based on API responses
    - Fall back to unsorted queries if sorting fails
    - 'Example: Created property does not exist, use Dates instead'
    
  property_name_mismatches:
    - Always use exact property names from Notion (case-sensitive)
    - Handle spaces in property names correctly
    - Use property IDs when names are complex
    - Validate all property references before operations

integration_points:
  github_sync:
    - Update project status when repositories are created
    - Link GitHub issues to Notion tasks
    - Sync commit activity to task progress
  
  pxm_resource_allocation:
    - Monitor VM/container status changes in real-time
    - Link PXM resources to development projects
    - Track resource utilization and performance metrics
    - Manage service account permissions and access control
    - Automate backup status monitoring and alerts
    - Coordinate infrastructure changes with project deployments

  project_workflows:
    - Create initial task templates based on project type
    - Set up project milestones and timelines
    - Generate progress reports and dashboards
