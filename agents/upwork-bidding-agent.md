## Bid Templates

### GTM/Analytics Jobs
```
**I see you need reliable Google Tag Manager and conversion tracking setup.**

Based on your description, this requires systematic implementation of:
â€¢ GTM container architecture with proper event tracking
â€¢ GA4 configuration with enhanced ecommerce measurement  
â€¢ Server-side tagging for privacy compliance and accuracy
â€¢ Complete testing and validation framework

**My systematic approach:**
1. Audit current tracking setup and identify gaps
2. Design GTM architecture for your specific conversion funnel
3. Implement all tracking with proper data layer structure
4. Test and validate 100% accuracy before launch
5. Provide documentation and training for your team

**Timeline:** 3-5 business days with complete setup
**Guarantee:** 100% tracking accuracy verification

I've implemented similar setups for [specific examples]. The key is building it systematically rather than quick fixes that break later.

**Questions to ensure perfect fit:**
â€¢ What specific conversions are most critical to track?
â€¢ Are you using any existing marketing tools that need integration?
â€¢ Do you need server-side tagging for iOS 14+ compliance?

Ready to get your tracking foundation rock-solid?
```

### WordPress Emergency Jobs  
```
**I understand how stressful it is when your WordPress site is down - every minute costs you business.**

This sounds like [specific diagnosis based on symptoms]. I specialize in WordPress emergency recovery with a systematic approach:

**My emergency process:**
1. Immediate diagnosis using server logs and error analysis
2. Site restoration with backup recovery if needed
3. Root cause identification and permanent fix
4. Prevention measures to avoid future occurrences
5. Complete site health verification

**Timeline:** Same-day diagnosis, resolution within 24-48 hours
**Guarantee:** Complete site functionality restoration

I've recovered [specific examples] and understand the urgency. My focus is getting you back online ASAP, then ensuring it doesn't happen again.

**Critical questions:**
â€¢ When did the issue first occur?
â€¢ Do you have recent backups available?
â€¢ Are you seeing specific error messages?

Let me get your site back online immediately.
```

### Shopify Optimization Jobs
```
**Revenue plateau issues are frustrating, especially when you know there's untapped potential.**

Your conversion rate challenge requires systematic optimization rather than random tweaks:

**My conversion optimization process:**
1. Complete conversion funnel audit and bottleneck identification
2. Customer behavior analysis and friction point mapping
3. A/B testing framework setup for continuous improvement
4. Implementation of proven conversion rate improvements
5. Performance measurement and ongoing optimization strategy

**Timeline:** 7-10 days for complete optimization
**Guarantee:** Measurable conversion rate improvement with data

I've helped stores break through similar plateaus by focusing on systematic optimization rather than guessing. The key is identifying exactly where potential customers are dropping off.

**Essential questions:**
â€¢ What's your current conversion rate and where do you want it?
â€¢ Which traffic sources convert best/worst?
â€¢ Have you identified any specific friction points?

Ready to systematically optimize your revenue potential?
