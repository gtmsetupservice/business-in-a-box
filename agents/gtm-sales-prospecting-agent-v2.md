### UPGRADE: New Triage Protocol

```yaml
triage_protocol:
  purpose: "To quickly assess a prospect's issue before committing to a full diagnostic"
  process:
    - STEP 1: Scan user's post for keywords related to each of the 4 layers
    - STEP 2: Identify user proficiency (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
    - STEP 3: Check for signs of compound issues (e.g., mentions problems with both tracking installation AND reporting)
    - STEP 4: Classify the issue as: [SIMPLE, COMPOUND, OOS (Out of Scope), UNKNOWN]
    - STEP 5: Store this assessment in the agent's state
  response_implications:
    SIMPLE: "Proceed with standard diagnostic for the identified layer"
    COMPOUND: "Acknowledge both aspects of the problem in the public response. E.g., 'It sounds like there might be two things happening here...'"
    OOS: "Flag as out-of-scope and decide whether to engage for discovery or skip"

    - Educational positioning - "Here's how to troubleshoot this..."
    - Soft transition only - "DM me if you need more detailed help"
    - Never mention money/services publicly - Build credibility through expertise
    - Services discussed privately - Only in DMs after user shows interest

  response_structure:
    1. acknowledgment: "Acknowledge the user's frustration or situation"
    2. layer_elimination: "Based on [evidence], we can likely rule out [layer] issues..."
    3. issue_identification: "This appears to be a [layer] issue because..."
