### Common Queries
```sql
-- List all ingested channels
SELECT channel_id, title,
       statistics->>'subscriberCount' as subscribers,
       statistics->>'videoCount' as videos
FROM channels
ORDER BY (statistics->>'subscriberCount')::int DESC;

-- Get channel videos sorted by views
SELECT video_id, title,
       statistics->>'viewCount' as views,
       published_at
FROM videos
WHERE channel_id = 'UCxxxxxx'
ORDER BY (statistics->>'viewCount')::int DESC;

-- Find videos by keyword in title
SELECT video_id, title, published_at
FROM videos
WHERE title ILIKE '%keyword%'
ORDER BY published_at DESC;

-- Channel analytics summary
SELECT
  c.title as channel,
  COUNT(v.id) as video_count,
  SUM((v.statistics->>'viewCount')::bigint) as total_views,
  AVG((v.statistics->>'viewCount')::bigint) as avg_views
FROM channels c
LEFT JOIN videos v ON c.channel_id = v.channel_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.title;

-- Recent uploads across all channels
SELECT
  c.title as channel,
  v.title as video,
  v.published_at,
  v.statistics->>'viewCount' as views
FROM videos v
JOIN channels c ON v.channel_id = c.channel_id
ORDER BY v.published_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Channel Ingestion
```bash
# Ingest channel by @handle
User: "Ingest @SuperHumansLife into ytdb"
Agent: Uses mcp__ytdb__ingest_channel with "@SuperHumansLife"

# Ingest channel by ID
User: "Ingest channel UC123abc into ytdb"
Agent: Uses mcp__ytdb__ingest_channel with "UC123abc"

# Ingest with custom video limit
User: "Ingest @AIGuy with 100 videos"
Agent: Uses mcp__ytdb__ingest_channel with "@AIGuy", max_videos=100
```

### Data Querying
```bash
# List all channels
User: "Show me all ingested channels"
Agent: SELECT channel_id, title, statistics FROM channels

# Get channel details
User: "Show me details for SuperHumans Life"
Agent: SELECT * FROM channels WHERE title ILIKE '%SuperHumans%'

# Find videos on specific topic
User: "Find videos about AI from all channels"
Agent: SELECT * FROM videos WHERE title ILIKE '%AI%' OR description ILIKE '%AI%'
```

### Analytics Operations
```bash
# Channel performance
User: "Show me analytics for channel UC123"
Agent: Aggregates video statistics, calculates averages, trends

# Top performing videos
User: "What are the top 10 videos by views?"
Agent: SELECT from videos ORDER BY views DESC LIMIT 10

# Recent content
User: "Show me videos published this month"
Agent: SELECT where published_at > current_month
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
```yaml
channel_not_found:
  symptom: "No channel found with ID: xyz"
  resolution: "Verify channel ID or @handle is correct"

api_key_missing:
  symptom: "YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY not set"
  resolution: "Check MCP server configuration has API key"

database_connection:
  symptom: "Failed to connect to PostgreSQL"
  resolution: "Verify database credentials and connectivity"

quota_exceeded:
  symptom: "YouTube API quota exceeded"
  resolution: "Wait for quota reset or reduce batch sizes"

malformed_data:
  symptom: "JSON parsing error"
  resolution: "Check YouTube API response format"
```

## Best Practices

### Ingestion Strategy
```yaml
initial_ingestion:
  - Start with max_videos=50 to test
  - Verify data quality before full ingestion
  - Monitor API quota usage
  - Use max_videos=500 for comprehensive channels

updates:
  - Re-ingest channels monthly for fresh stats
  - Use ON CONFLICT UPDATE to refresh data
  - Focus on active channels for frequent updates

data_integrity:
  - Always check ingestion results
  - Verify video counts match expectations
  - Monitor for failed insertions
```

### Query Optimization
```yaml
performance:
  - Use indexes on channel_id and video_id
  - Query jsonb fields with ->> operator for scalars
  - Use ILIKE for case-insensitive searches
  - Limit result sets for large datasets

analytics:
  - Cast statistics to appropriate types (bigint, int)
  - Aggregate at channel level for summaries
  - Use CTEs for complex multi-step queries
```
