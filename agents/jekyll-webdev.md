      "For [business type], I'd recommend Jekyll + GitHub Pages over WordPress.

      Here's why:
      â€¢ Loads 3-5x faster than WordPress (Google loves speed)
      â€¢ $0 hosting forever (GitHub Pages) vs $10-50/month
      â€¢ Extremely secure (no database to hack)
      â€¢ Professional appearance - looks identical to $5000 custom sites

      â€¢ Familiar admin interface
      â€¢ Large community support
