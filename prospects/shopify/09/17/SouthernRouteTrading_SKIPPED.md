## Problem Summary
New store owner struggling with traffic generation beyond expensive Meta ads, seeking alternative growth strategies after receiving merchandise 3 weeks ago.

**Original Post:**
> "If you had to start again, how would you go about getting traffic and first sales? I started my shop a couple months ago, and received merchandise about 3 weeks ago. Getting traffic to my site is a challenge; I know a lot of people do FB/IG ads, but that can get expensive. Aside from dumping a small fortune in Meta ads, how did you generate traffic to your store?"

## Urgency Assessment
**Score: 4/10 (Low-Medium)**
- New store (2 months old, merchandise received 3 weeks ago)
- Seeking growth advice rather than fixing broken functionality
- Not revenue-critical emergency but business development need

## 4-Layer Shopify Triage
**Primary Layer: Layer 4 (Design/Optimization Issues)**
- Store exists and functions but lacks systematic traffic acquisition strategy
- Not a technical problem, but growth optimization challenge
- Needs comprehensive store audit to identify traffic generation opportunities

**Issue Type: Simple Issue**
- Single problem domain: traffic generation
- No mention of technical failures or complex integrations
- Focused on marketing/growth strategy

**Proficiency Level: Beginner**
- Recently started store
- Only familiar with expensive Meta ads
- Seeking foundational growth guidance

## Business Context Analysis
**Current Situation:**
- Store operational for 2 months
- Merchandise received 3 weeks ago (suggests physical product business)
- Aware of Meta ads but concerned about cost

- Risk of business failure without establishing customer acquisition

**Pain Points:**

- Cost concerns about paid advertising
- No clear growth strategy or framework

## Competitive Analysis
**Existing Responses: 4 responses**
1. **u/webmeca**: "What you selling?" - Basic product inquiry
2. **u/souravghosh**: Asks about sales so far, suggests offline word-of-mouth marketing
3. **[Truncated responses]** - Appear to be general marketing suggestions

**Quality Assessment: Poor to Generic**

## Revenue Opportunity Assessment
**Conversion Probability: Medium (6/10)**

- Has invested in physical inventory (committed to business)
- Cost-conscious but willing to invest in growth
- Early stage means lower budget but higher need

**Estimated Value: $319 (Complete Store Audit)**

## Recommended Response Strategy
