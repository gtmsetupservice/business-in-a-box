## 4-Layer Shopify Diagnostic Analysis

### Layer 1 (Store Foundation) - ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY ISSUE
**Problem Identified:** Account restriction preventing access to essential plan features

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Shopify Trial Limitation:** $1 trial has artificial restrictions on plan upgrades
- **Security Lock:** Shopify's system preventing legitimate upgrade attempts
- **Account Status Issue:** Trial account may be flagged or restricted
- **Billing System Bug:** Payment processing may be blocked for trial accounts
- **Plan Transition Logic:** System logic preventing trial-to-annual upgrade path

**Validation Methods:**
1. **Account Status Check:** Verify account standing in Shopify admin notifications
2. **Billing Information Test:** Ensure payment methods are properly configured
3. **Alternative Upgrade Paths:** Test monthly plan upgrade before annual
4. **Support Escalation:** Request supervisor/technical support for account review
5. **Account Recreation:** Consider fresh account setup if restrictions persist

### Layer 2 (Configuration) - âœ… Not Applicable
- User understands configuration requirements
- Issue is access to configuration options, not setup

### Layer 3 (Functionality) - âœ… Not Applicable
- Shipping functionality would work once plan access is resolved
- No app or feature functionality issues

### Layer 4 (Optimization) - âœ… Not Applicable
- No optimization needs at this stage
- Focus is on basic plan access
