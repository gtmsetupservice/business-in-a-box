# Purchase Tracking Issue - SquareLengthiness435

## Problem Description
Why don't I see purchase event in data layer when I make Purchase in the website? There is an issue in my website where purchases are not being properly tracked and when. I check I see that purchase event is t shown in data layer when I purchase.

## Reddit Reply

I see you're dealing with purchase events not appearing in your dataLayer - this is definitely frustrating when you're trying to track conversions properly.

Looking at your issue, this appears to be a **configuration issue** - your purchase tracking setup needs attention.

To validate what's happening, you can run this diagnostic in your browser console:

```javascript
(() => {
  const originalPush = dataLayer.push;
  dataLayer.push = function() {
    if (arguments[0].event === 'purchase') {
      console.log('ðŸŽ¯ PURCHASE DETECTED:', arguments[0]);
    }
    return originalPush.apply(this, arguments);
  };
  return 'Monitoring for purchase events - complete a test order';
})();
```

Then complete a test purchase. This will tell you if the purchase event is actually being pushed to the dataLayer, which helps isolate whether it's a dataLayer issue or something else in your tracking chain.

## DM Script
Hi SquareLengthiness435, thanks for running that diagnostic. Based on the results, I can see exactly what's happening with your purchase tracking. This is a common issue that typically takes about 4 hours to fix properly. I run GTMSetupService.com and we handle these exact issues daily. Would you like me to walk you through fixing it yourself, or would you prefer we handle it for you?

## Full Solution
1. Verify purchase completion page loads
2. Add dataLayer.push with purchase event
3. Configure GTM trigger for purchase event
4. Set up GA4/Ads purchase tags
5. Test end-to-end with real purchase

## Objection Handling
Without purchase tracking, you can't measure ROI or optimize campaigns. This directly impacts revenue attribution.
