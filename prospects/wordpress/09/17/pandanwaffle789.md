**Urgency:** HIGH (8/10)
**Issue Type:** Simple Issue - Display/Content Problems

## Problem Summary
Website has lost **all color and CSS styling** on the frontend. User tried clearing cache via Elementor tools but it had no effect. Cannot find "Regenerate CSS" button in Elementor > Tools. **Edit mode shows styling correctly**, but frontend displays without any styling - complete visual breakdown.

## Technical Details
- **Platform:** WordPress with Elementor
- **Issue:** Complete CSS/styling failure on frontend
- **Edit Mode:** Styling appears correctly in Elementor editor
- **Frontend:** No colors, no styling, broken visual appearance
- **Attempted Fix:** Cleared cache via Elementor tools (no effect)
- **Missing Feature:** Cannot locate "Regenerate CSS" button in Elementor > Tools
- **Scope:** Complete site-wide styling loss

## Triage Assessment

### Primary Issue - Layer 4: Content/Display Issues
- **Complete CSS failure** on frontend while editor works normally
- **CSS generation/delivery problem** - Elementor not applying styles to frontend
- **Cache or CSS file corruption** - Styling data exists but not being applied

### User Proficiency: Beginner-Intermediate
- **Basic troubleshooting attempted** - Tried cache clearing
- **Tool navigation knowledge** - Knows about Elementor > Tools section
- **Problem description clarity** - Can distinguish between edit mode vs frontend
- **Frustrated urgency** - Using emojis, seeking immediate help

## Suspected Root Causes

### Most Likely:
1. **Elementor CSS file corruption** - Generated CSS files damaged or missing
2. **CSS delivery failure** - Files exist but not being loaded by browser
3. **Plugin conflict** - Another plugin interfering with Elementor CSS generation
4. **File permissions** - CSS files exist but server cannot serve them
5. **Caching plugin conflict** - Aggressive caching preventing CSS updates

### Secondary Possibilities:
1. **WordPress theme conflict** - Theme overriding Elementor styles
2. **Database corruption** - Elementor styling data corrupted in database
3. **CDN/caching issues** - External caching serving old/broken CSS
4. **Server-side issues** - PHP/memory limits preventing CSS generation
5. **Elementor plugin corruption** - Plugin files damaged requiring reinstall

## Business Impact Analysis
- **Website Completely Broken Visually:** Unprofessional appearance damages credibility
- **User Experience Ruined:** Visitors see unstyled, broken layout
- **Business Operations Affected:** Cannot use website for business purposes
- **Immediate Action Required:** Every minute of broken styling loses potential customers
- **SEO/Brand Impact:** Search engines and visitors see broken site
