# Response to u/cfspartan14 - Ultimate Member Email Invites Not Sending

## Public Reddit Response

I can see this is a very frustrating situation - having your user management system break down after what seemed like a simple email change is really disruptive, especially when you need users to be able to manage their own passwords.

Based on your description, this appears to be both a **configuration issue** AND a **functionality issue**. The fact that the first user invite worked fine, but everything broke after adding the email sender plugin, suggests there's a cascade of problems that need systematic diagnosis rather than just trying more SMTP solutions.

Here's how to validate what's actually happening with your WordPress email system:

**First, test WordPress core email functionality:**
1. Try sending a test email from WordPress admin (if you have any contact forms or email testing plugins)
2. Create a simple PHP test to check if wp_mail() function is working at all
3. Check if WordPress is still trying to send ANY emails (password resets, admin notifications, etc.)

**For Ultimate Member specific diagnosis:**
1. Go to Ultimate Member → Settings → Email and check if email templates are still configured
2. Look for any Ultimate Member email queue or failed email logs
3. Test with a completely new user registration (not just resending old invites)
4. Check if the plugin is creating user accounts but just not sending emails

**WordPress email system restoration:**
The issue likely isn't just SMTP configuration - when you added that first email sender plugin, it probably modified WordPress's core email handling in a way that didn't get fully reversed when you removed it. This often leaves database entries or modified hooks that continue to interfere with email delivery.

**What to check for:**
- Database entries in wp_options related to email settings from the removed plugins
- WordPress hooks that might still be modified from the original email plugin
- Ultimate Member's specific email queue system (separate from general WordPress emails)

The fact that even after removing all email plugins, the emails still don't send, suggests the problem is deeper than just SMTP configuration - something in the WordPress email system itself was disrupted.

Have you been able to test if ANY WordPress emails work (like admin notifications or contact form emails), or is it specifically just Ultimate Member invitations that are failing?

## Private DM Follow-up

**Opening:**
Hi! Thanks for letting me help with your Ultimate Member email issue. Having your user management system break down like this is really disruptive - you need that invitation and password reset workflow working for your business operations.

**Problem Validation:**
Based on what you described, this is what I call a "plugin cascade issue" - the original email sender plugin disrupted WordPress's core email functionality, and even though you removed it, the damage to the email system persists. This is why trying more SMTP plugins hasn't worked - the problem is deeper than just email delivery configuration.

**Why Standard SMTP Solutions Fail:**
When an email plugin modifies WordPress's core email handling and then gets removed improperly, it often leaves behind:
- **Database entries** in wp_options that override normal email behavior
- **Modified WordPress hooks** that redirect or block email functions
- **Ultimate Member specific settings** that got corrupted during the email plugin conflicts
- **WordPress core email queue issues** that prevent any emails from being processed

**Business Impact:**
I understand this is affecting your operations since you can't:
- Onboard new users through the normal invitation process
- Allow users to reset their own passwords independently  
- Maintain the automated user management workflow you need
- Scale your user base without manual intervention

**My Approach:**
I specialize in Ultimate Member troubleshooting and WordPress email system restoration. This type of issue requires:

1. **WordPress core email diagnosis** - Test and restore wp_mail() functionality
2. **Ultimate Member integration analysis** - Ensure plugin email queue is working properly
3. **Database cleanup** - Remove remnants from failed email plugin attempts
4. **SMTP optimization** - Proper Brevo setup (or alternative) once core system is restored
5. **Complete workflow testing** - Invitation → user account → password reset verification
6. **Prevention documentation** - Avoid future email system disruption

**Plugin Conflict Resolution Service ($297)**

This includes:
- Complete diagnosis of WordPress core email system integrity
- Ultimate Member plugin email functionality restoration  
- Database cleanup from failed email plugin attempts
- Proper SMTP configuration (Brevo or recommended alternative)
- End-to-end user management workflow testing
- Documentation of all fixes and prevention measures

**Why This Works:**
- Specific experience with Ultimate Member email issues and WordPress core email restoration
- Systematic approach to plugin cascade problems rather than trial-and-error SMTP attempts
- Focus on business workflow restoration, not just technical fixes
- Understanding of both WordPress email infrastructure AND Ultimate Member specifics

**Timeline:**
- WordPress email system diagnosis: Same day
- Ultimate Member restoration and SMTP setup: 24-48 hours  
- Complete workflow testing and documentation: Included

**What Makes This Different:**
Unlike generic SMTP troubleshooting, this addresses the underlying WordPress email system corruption and ensures Ultimate Member's user management workflow is fully restored.

**Perfect for Your Situation:**
Since you need automated user invitations and password resets working for business operations, getting professional restoration makes sense rather than continuing to try different SMTP plugins that don't address the root cause.

The goal is to get your user management system back to the reliable state it was in before the email plugin disruption, plus properly configured SMTP for ongoing reliability.

Would you like me to start with the WordPress email system diagnosis? I can usually identify the specific email system issues within a few hours and begin the restoration process.
