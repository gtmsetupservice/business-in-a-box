**Posted:** September 17, 2025 (17 hours ago)
**Subreddit:** r/Wordpress
**Post ID:** 1nisr56
**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1nisr56/ultimate_member_user_invites_will_not_sent/
**Urgency:** HIGH (7/10)
**Issue Type:** Compound Issue - Configuration + Functionality Problems

## Problem Summary
User is experiencing complete failure of Ultimate Member plugin email invitations. First user invitation worked fine, but after installing email sender plugin to change from default "wordpress@" address, no subsequent user invitations are being sent despite trying multiple SMTP solutions including Brevo. User cannot manually set passwords and needs automated invitation system to work.

## Technical Details
- **Plugin:** Ultimate Member (user registration/management)
- **Initial State:** First user invite worked (sent from wordpress@ email)
- **Problem Trigger:** Added "something Sender" plugin to change sender email
- **Failed Solutions Attempted:**
  - Multiple SMTP plugins (tried several)
  - Brevo SMTP integration
  - Deactivated and deleted all mail-related plugins
  - Email still not sending even after removing all mail plugins
- **Email Testing:** Checked quarantine, spam, "everything else"
- **Critical Need:** Cannot manually set passwords, users must be able to reset independently

## Triage Assessment

### Primary Issue - Layer 2: Configuration Issues
- **Plugin conflict cascade** - Email sender plugin disrupted Ultimate Member functionality
- **SMTP configuration problems** - Multiple attempts at email delivery setup failing
- **WordPress email system corruption** - Even after removing plugins, emails not sending

### Secondary Issue - Layer 3: Functionality Issues  
- **User registration workflow broken** - Cannot complete user onboarding process
- **Password management failure** - Users cannot reset passwords independently
- **Business process disruption** - Critical user management functionality non-operational

### User Proficiency: Intermediate
- **Systematic troubleshooting** - Tried multiple SMTP solutions methodically
- **Plugin management experience** - Understands activation/deactivation process
- **Technical awareness** - Knows to check spam/quarantine folders
- **Business understanding** - Recognizes impact on user management workflow

## Suspected Root Causes

### Immediate Causes:
1. **WordPress email function corruption** - Original "something Sender" plugin damaged core email functionality
2. **Database remnants** - Plugin deactivation didn't clean database email settings
3. **SMTP configuration conflicts** - Multiple plugin attempts created conflicting settings
4. **Ultimate Member email queue issues** - Plugin-specific email queue corruption

### Systemic Issues:
1. **WordPress core email settings** - wp_mail() function or related hooks compromised
2. **Server email configuration** - Host email delivery restrictions or changes
3. **Ultimate Member plugin integrity** - User management plugin database corruption
4. **Email delivery infrastructure** - External delivery service configuration problems

## Business Impact Analysis
- **User Onboarding Blocked:** Cannot add new users to system
- **Password Management Broken:** Users cannot reset passwords independently  
- **Workflow Disruption:** Manual user management creates operational overhead
- **System Integrity:** Core business functionality (user management) compromised
- **Scalability Issues:** Cannot grow user base without working invitation system

## Competitive Analysis - Existing Responses

### Response Quality Assessment:
- **Total Responses:** 2 comments
- **Quality:** Basic SMTP troubleshooting focus
- **Diagnostic Depth:** Limited to email delivery mechanics

### Specific Responses:
1. **u/password_qwerty_3** - "I have worked with Brevo and WordPress SMTP" + request for chat/details
2. **u/bluesix_v2** - Brevo domain setup questions, screenshot request, "Post SMTP" plugin recommendation

### Gap Analysis:
- **No Ultimate Member focus** - Missing plugin-specific troubleshooting
- **No configuration cascade analysis** - Not addressing how initial plugin broke functionality
- **No WordPress core email diagnosis** - Missing fundamental email system assessment
- **No systematic restoration approach** - Just more SMTP plugin suggestions
- **No business process consideration** - Missing user management workflow impact

## Service Fit Analysis

### Recommended Service: Plugin Conflict Resolution ($297)

**Why This Service:**
- **Compound configuration issue** - Multiple layers of email system disruption
- **Plugin conflict cascade** - Original plugin broke functionality, subsequent attempts failed
- **Systematic restoration needed** - Requires methodical approach to restore working state
- **Business-critical functionality** - User management system essential for operations

### Service Scope Should Include:
1. **WordPress Email System Diagnosis** - Test core wp_mail() functionality
2. **Ultimate Member Integration Analysis** - Plugin-specific email queue and settings
3. **Database Cleanup** - Remove remnants from failed plugin attempts
4. **SMTP Configuration Optimization** - Proper Brevo or alternative setup
5. **User Workflow Testing** - Complete invitation to password reset process verification
6. **Prevention Documentation** - Avoid future email system disruption

## Response Strategy

### Public Response Approach:
1. **Acknowledge Cascade Problem** - "Plugin conflicts created multiple email system issues"
2. **Layer Identification** - "This appears to be both configuration AND functionality issues"
3. **Systematic Diagnostic** - WordPress core email testing vs more SMTP attempts
4. **Ultimate Member Focus** - Plugin-specific troubleshooting vs generic email advice
5. **Business Process Understanding** - User management workflow restoration

### Key Differentiators:
- **Plugin conflict expertise** vs generic SMTP troubleshooting
- **Ultimate Member specialization** vs general email delivery
- **Systematic restoration** vs trial-and-error plugin attempts
- **WordPress core email diagnosis** vs external service focus only
- **Business workflow understanding** vs technical-only perspective

## Conversion Probability: High

### Positive Indicators:
- ✅ **Business-critical functionality broken** (user management essential)
- ✅ **Multiple failed DIY attempts** (ready for professional help)

- ✅ **Clear workflow impact** (cannot onboard users or manage passwords)
- ✅ **Inadequate existing solutions** (more of the same SMTP suggestions)
- ✅ **Technical awareness** (understands complexity, tried logical steps)

### Success Factors:
- **Emphasize Ultimate Member expertise** - Plugin-specific vs generic email
- **Systematic restoration approach** - Fix root cause vs more trial-and-error
- **Business continuity focus** - User management workflow restoration
- **WordPress core competency** - Email system integrity vs just SMTP configuration
- **Reasonable pricing** - $297 appropriate for critical business functionality

### Potential Objections:
- May try more SMTP plugins based on existing advice
