# Public Response Templates for Reddit Engagement

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Only identify the layer and provide validation method
2. Never mention pricing publicly
3. Never provide the actual fix
4. Stop after validation - let them ask for more
5. No sales pitch in public responses

## Layer 1: Infrastructure Problems

**Template:**
```
Looking at your issue, this appears to be a Layer 1 (Infrastructure) problem - GTM isn't loading properly.

To validate this is actually Layer 1, run this in your browser console:

(() => {
  const checks = {
    gtm: !!document.querySelector('script[src*="googletagmanager.com"]'),
    dataLayer: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined'
  };
  return checks.gtm && checks.dataLayer ?
    '✅ GTM loaded' : '❌ GTM not loading';
})();

This will tell you if GTM is actually initializing on your page.
```

**Common Variations:**
- Consent blocking: "Check if consent mode is blocking GTM initialization"
- Ad blockers: "Check Network tab for blocked googletagmanager.com requests"
- CSP issues: "Look for Content Security Policy errors in console"

## Layer 2: Implementation Problems

**Template:**
```
Looking at your issue, this appears to be a Layer 2 (Implementation) problem - your GTM configuration isn't set up correctly.

To validate this is actually Layer 2, check in GTM Preview mode:
1. Does your trigger fire when expected?
2. Does the variable resolve to the correct value?
3. Is the tag firing but showing an error?

You can also run this to see what's in your dataLayer:

dataLayer.filter(e => e.event).map(e => e.event)

This will show you all events that have fired.
```

**Common Variations:**
- Wrong trigger: "Your trigger conditions might not match the actual event"
- Missing variable: "The variable you're referencing might not exist when the tag fires"
- Tag sequencing: "Check if your tags are firing in the wrong order"

## Layer 3: Transmission Problems

**Template:**
```
Looking at your issue, this appears to be a Layer 3 (Transmission) problem - data isn't reaching Google's servers.

To validate this is actually Layer 3, check your Network tab:
1. Filter for "collect"
2. Look for requests to google-analytics.com/g/collect
3. Check if they return status 204

You can also run this diagnostic:

performance.getEntriesByType('resource')
  .filter(e => e.name.includes('/g/collect')).length

This tells you how many GA4 requests were sent.
```

**Common Variations:**
- Server-side handoff: "Check if requests are reaching your server container"
- Network blocking: "Corporate firewall might be blocking analytics domains"
- Failed requests: "Look for red/failed requests in Network tab"

## Layer 4: Processing Problems

**Template:**
```
Looking at your issue, this appears to be a Layer 4 (Processing) problem - GA4 is receiving data but not processing it as expected.

To validate this is actually Layer 4:
1. Check GA4 DebugView - is the event arriving?
2. Check Realtime reports - does it show there?
3. Wait 24-48 hours - standard reports have processing delay

The data might be there but not visible due to processing time or filters.
```

**Common Variations:**
- Conversion marking: "Check if the event is marked as a conversion in GA4"
- Data thresholding: "Low user counts trigger privacy thresholding"
- Processing delay: "GA4 can take 24-48 hours to process data"

## DM Transition Triggers

**When they say:**
- "How do I fix this?"
- "Can you help me solve this?"
- "What should I do next?"
- "I ran the diagnostic and got [result]"

**Response:**
```
Happy to help you solve this. Mind if I DM you? I can walk through the specific fix for your situation.
```

## Example Real Responses

### For u/PaintingNo8479 (Server-side issue):
```
Looking at your issue, this appears to be a Layer 3 (Transmission) problem - your web container isn't successfully sending data to your server container.

To validate this is actually Layer 3, run this in your browser console:

performance.getEntriesByType('resource')
  .filter(e => e.name.includes('stape.io')).length

This will tell you if requests are actually being sent to your server container.
```

### For u/Yo485 (2% tracking):
```
Looking at your issue with only 2% tracking, this appears to be a Layer 1 (Infrastructure) problem - GTM isn't initializing for most users.

To validate this is actually Layer 1, check:
1. Is your GA4 tag trigger set to "Initialization" or "Page View"?
2. Run this: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined' && dataLayer.length

This will tell you if GTM is loading before or after consent.
```

### For u/Organic_Mission_2468 (GA4 but not Ads):
```
Looking at your issue, this appears to be a Layer 4 (Processing) problem - GA4 is receiving purchase data but Google Ads isn't importing it correctly.

To validate this is actually Layer 4:
1. In GA4, check Admin → Conversions - is 'purchase' marked as a conversion?
2. In Google Ads, check Tools → Conversions → GA4 import settings
3. Check if your conversion window matches when the purchase happened

This will tell you if it's an import/attribution issue rather than tracking.
```
