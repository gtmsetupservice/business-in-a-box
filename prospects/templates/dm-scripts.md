## DM OPENING MESSAGES

### Standard Opening
```
Hi [username], thanks for letting me help with your [specific problem].

Based on the diagnostic results, I can see exactly what's happening. This is a [common/specific] issue that typically takes [timeframe] to fix properly.

I run GTMSetupService.com and we handle these exact issues daily. Would you like me to:
1. Walk you through the fix yourself (I can guide you)
2. Or would you prefer we handle it for you?

What works better for your situation?
```

### For Server-Side Issues (Out of Scope)
```
Hi [username], thanks for sharing those diagnostic results.

Your server-side GTM setup has the handoff issue I suspected. This is actually outside our direct service area since it involves server container configuration.

Here's what I'd recommend:
1. Contact Stape support directly - they're the experts on their platform
2. Or if you'd prefer, we can diagnose the client-side part to confirm GTM is doing its job correctly

The good news is this is fixable - just needs the right expertise for the server part.

What would be most helpful for you?
```

### For High-Urgency Issues (98% Data Loss)
```
Hi [username], that diagnostic confirms what I suspected - you're losing almost all your tracking data.

This is actually a critical issue that's costing you money right now. Every day this isn't fixed, you're making decisions with incomplete data.

I run GTMSetupService.com and we specialize in exactly these emergency fixes. This specific issue typically takes about 4 hours to resolve completely.

Given the urgency, would you like me to:
1. Jump on a quick call today to walk through the fix
2. Or would you prefer we handle the entire fix for you?

Either way, we can get this sorted out today.
```

## QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS

### Budget Qualification (Subtle)
```
Just to understand your setup better - are you currently working with a developer or agency for your tracking, or handling this internally?
```

### Urgency Qualification
```
How long has this issue been happening? Is this affecting any current campaigns or important reporting?
```

### Technical Level Assessment
```
Are you comfortable making changes in GTM yourself, or would you prefer someone handle the technical implementation?
```

### Business Impact Assessment
```
Is this affecting any key metrics you're tracking for the business? Revenue attribution, conversion tracking, anything like that?
```

## SERVICE INTRODUCTION

### Emergency Recovery ($497)
```

We'll:

The whole thing typically takes about 4 hours and costs $497. Most clients see their data back to normal within the same day.

Would that work for your situation?
```

### Comprehensive Audit ($797)

Sound like what you're looking for?
```

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Can you just tell me how to fix it?"
```
I totally understand wanting to handle it yourself!

The challenge with this particular issue is that there are usually 3-4 different things that could be causing it, and the fix depends on exactly which one it is.

I could walk you through the diagnostic process to identify the exact cause, and then you'd have the specific steps for your situation. Would that work better for you?

(If yes, guide them through diagnosis, then offer service after they see the complexity)
```

### "That seems expensive"
```
I get that - let me break down what's included so you can see the value.

This isn't just fixing the immediate issue. We're also:
- Documenting exactly what was wrong so it doesn't happen again
- Testing everything thoroughly to make sure it's working correctly
- Providing you with a clear understanding of what happened

When you factor in that this issue is costing you [specific impact], the $497 usually pays for itself pretty quickly.

Plus, if we can't fix it, you don't pay. Does that make it feel more reasonable?
```

### "I need to think about it"
```
Absolutely, that makes total sense. This is an important decision.

While you're thinking about it, that diagnostic we ran is still showing the data loss continuing. Would it be helpful if I sent you a quick summary of exactly what we'd do and the timeline?

That way you have all the details to make the best decision for your business.
```

### "I want to try fixing it myself first"
```
That's totally fair! I respect that approach.

Here's what I'd suggest: try [one specific simple fix based on their issue]. If that doesn't solve it, then you know it's one of the more complex causes.

Feel free to reach out if you get stuck - I'll keep an eye out for your message.
```

## CLOSING

### Direct Close
```
Great! To get started, I'll need:
1. Access to your GTM container (view/edit permissions)
2. Access to your GA4 property (edit permissions)
3. A brief description of your main business goals for tracking

I can usually start on these within 24 hours and have them completed same-day or next-day depending on complexity.

Should I send over the access details you'll need to grant?
```

### Soft Close
```
Does this sound like the right approach for your situation?

If so, I can walk you through exactly what the next steps would be and how we'd get started.
```

### Timeline Close
```
Given that this is affecting your data right now, when would you ideally want this fixed by?

We can usually get emergency issues like this resolved within 24-48 hours once we start.
```
