# u/amsee01 EdTech GTM Case Study - Key Findings

## Prospect Intelligence Summary

**Business Profile**:
- EdTech company, 5 years Meta Ads experience
- Revenue source: Webinar signups (high-value education funnel)
- Just started Google Ads (yesterday) - burning money with zero attribution
- Technical competence: Already using GTM for Snapchat tracking

**Critical Problem**:
- GTM debug shows tags firing ✅
- Google Ads shows "No recent conversions" ❌
- Tag Assistant shows "installation error" ❌
- Both click-based AND pageview conversions failing

**Competitive Intelligence**:
- Already in DM with u/ShakeComfortable1975 for technical screen share
- Other helper focused on basic setup mechanics
- Window of opportunity: Position as EdTech attribution specialist

## Key Learning Points for Future Cases

### 1. EdTech Attribution Gap Pattern
**Problem**: Standard Google Ads attribution windows don't match education buying cycles
- **Meta/Facebook**: Works fine for immediate conversions
- **Google Ads**: Defaults miss 60-80% of EdTech conversions (2-7 day delay)
- **Webinar signups**: High consideration, delayed decision making

### 2. Technical Issue Diagnosis Framework
**Symptom**: GTM debug works + Tag Assistant error = Tag sequencing conflict
- Common when adding Google tags to existing multi-platform containers
- Snapchat + Google tag conflicts in firing order
- Conversion Linker timing issues

### 3. Competitive Positioning Strategy
**When Others Are Already Helping**:
- Acknowledge existing technical help (collaborative approach)
- Differentiate on industry specialization (EdTech expertise)
- Focus on advanced problems (attribution modeling vs basic setup)
- Position as complementary expert (emergency audit + verification)

### 4. Revenue Potential Indicators
**High-Value Signals**:
- ✅ Multi-year advertising experience (Meta Ads 5 years)
- ✅ Existing GTM implementation (technical sophistication)
- ✅ Active daily ad spend with zero attribution
- ✅ Willing to do video calls for solutions
- ✅ Educational industry (higher LTV, complex funnels)

**Revenue Range**: $497-$1,297 (Emergency fix + Attribution setup)

## Response Framework for Similar Cases

### Phase 1: Immediate Technical Value
- Acknowledge their current help situation
- Provide specific diagnostic steps for their exact error
- Show industry-specific knowledge (EdTech attribution windows)

### Phase 2: Advanced Problem Identification
- Highlight delayed conversion attribution gaps
- Explain why "fix" might not solve real problem
- Position as specialist in education marketing funnels

### Phase 3: Collaborative Positioning
- Offer complementary expertise (not competitive)
- Suggest emergency audit alongside existing help
- Immediate DM transition with specific diagnostic tool

## Strategic Insights

### What Worked:
- Industry specialization positioning (EdTech vs generic GTM)
- Technical credibility (Tag Assistant error explanation)
- Collaborative approach (working alongside existing help)
- Immediate value offer (diagnostic checklist)

### Lessons for Future:
- EdTech businesses have consistent attribution gap patterns
- Technical competence doesn't equal attribution knowledge
- Meta→Google transitions create predictable problems
- Video call willingness = high conversion probability

### Case Study Value:
This case demonstrates the importance of industry-specific expertise positioning over generic GTM knowledge. Technical fixes alone don't solve business attribution problems in education marketing.

## Follow-up Recommendations:
- Monitor for similar EdTech→Google Ads transition posts
- Develop standardized EdTech attribution diagnostic checklist
- Create case study content around delayed conversion attribution
- Position as education marketing specialist in future responses
