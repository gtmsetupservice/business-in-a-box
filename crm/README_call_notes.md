# Call Notes CRM Integration

## Table Created: 2025-09-23

### Purpose
Track all diagnostic and sales calls with prospects to:
- Identify patterns in technical issues
- Improve diagnostic process through review
- Build case study content from real scenarios
- Measure conversion rates and confidence levels

### Schema
```sql
call_notes
├── post_id (links to Reddit source)
├── username
├── call_date
├── call_type (diagnostic/closing/follow-up)
├── call_duration (minutes)
├── issue_layer (1-4 from diagnostic framework)
├── root_cause
├── plugin_involved
├── technical_diagnosis
├── client_resistance_points
├── missed_opportunities
├── estimated_value
├── service_recommended
├── proposal_sent
├── key_learning
├── confidence_level (1-10)
├── recording_url
├── follow_up_required
└── next_contact_date
```

### Usage After Each Call
```sql
-- Quick entry template
INSERT INTO call_notes (
    username, call_date, call_type, issue_layer,
    root_cause, missed_opportunities, key_learning,
    confidence_level
) VALUES (
    'username', datetime('now'), 'diagnostic', 'Layer X',
    'What broke', 'What I missed', 'What I learned',
    7
);
```

### Analysis Queries

**Pattern Recognition:**
```sql
-- Most common plugins causing issues
SELECT plugin_involved, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM call_notes
WHERE plugin_involved IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY plugin_involved
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- Average confidence by call type
SELECT call_type, AVG(confidence_level) as avg_confidence
FROM call_notes
GROUP BY call_type;
```

**Conversion Tracking:**
```sql
-- Diagnostic to proposal conversion rate
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN proposal_sent = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as conversion_rate
FROM call_notes
WHERE call_type = 'diagnostic';
```

**Learning Database:**
```sql
-- Recent learnings for review
SELECT username, call_date, key_learning, missed_opportunities
FROM call_notes
WHERE call_date > date('now', '-7 days')
ORDER BY call_date DESC;
```
