# Pattern Selection and Implementation Procedure

## Overview
A systematic methodology for identifying, customizing, and implementing GTM architectural patterns to achieve specific business tracking objectives.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Pattern Matching

### Step 1.1: Business Requirements Gathering

**Collect Core Information:**
```
□ Industry/Vertical: _________________
□ Website Type: [ ] E-commerce [ ] SaaS [ ] Lead Gen [ ] Content [ ] Corporate
□ Tech Stack: [ ] WordPress [ ] Shopify [ ] React [ ] Vue [ ] Custom
□ Current Analytics: [ ] GA4 [ ] UA [ ] None [ ] Other: _______
□ Ad Platforms: [ ] Google Ads [ ] Facebook [ ] LinkedIn [ ] Other: _______
□ CRM/Backend: [ ] HubSpot [ ] Salesforce [ ] Custom [ ] None
```

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. What are your top 3 conversion actions?
2. What's your biggest data challenge right now?
3. What decisions do you need data to support?
4. What's your monthly ad spend?
5. Do you have developers available?

### Step 1.2: Pattern Scoring Matrix

Rate each pattern's relevance (0-10) based on client needs:

| Pattern | Relevance Indicators | Score |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **Enhanced Ecommerce** | Sells products, has cart, needs revenue tracking | ___ |
| **Form Analytics** | Lead forms, multi-step forms, high abandonment | ___ |
| **Virtual Page View** | SPA, React/Vue app, AJAX navigation | ___ |
| **Cookie Consent** | EU traffic, California users, privacy-conscious | ___ |
| **Error Tracking** | Complex app, frequent updates, user complaints | ___ |
| **User ID Sync** | Logged-in users, subscription model, B2B | ___ |
| **Scroll Depth** | Long content, blogs, high bounce rate | ___ |
| **Cross-Domain** | Multiple domains, separate checkout domain | ___ |
| **Engagement Time** | Content site, need quality metrics, CPM ads | ___ |
| **A/B Test** | Running experiments, multiple variants | ___ |
| **Campaign** | Heavy paid media, QR codes, email marketing | ___ |
| **Debug Mode** | Development team, frequent changes | ___ |
| **Custom Dimension** | Complex categorization, user segments | ___ |
| **Generic Event** | Many event types, want simplicity | ___ |
| **Lazy Load** | Image-heavy, infinite scroll, performance focus | ___ |

**Selection Rule:** Patterns scoring 7+ are PRIMARY, 4-6 are SECONDARY, <4 are OPTIONAL

### Step 1.3: Pattern Dependency Mapping

Check pattern dependencies:
```
IF (Enhanced Ecommerce) THEN REQUIRES (Cross-Domain if checkout separate)
IF (Form Analytics) THEN BENEFITS FROM (Error Tracking)
IF (Cookie Consent) THEN MODIFIES (All other patterns)
IF (User ID Sync) THEN ENHANCES (All conversion patterns)
IF (Debug Mode) THEN SUPPORTS (All patterns in dev)
```

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Customization

### Step 2.1: Variable Mapping Template

For each selected pattern, map client-specific variables:

```javascript
// Pattern: [PATTERN_NAME]
// Client: [CLIENT_NAME]
// Date: [DATE]

const patternConfig = {
  // Business Variables
  businessType: '[e-commerce|saas|lead-gen|content]',
  primaryDomain: '[client-domain.com]',
  additionalDomains: ['checkout.domain.com', 'app.domain.com'],

  // Technical Variables
  gtmContainerId: 'GTM-[XXXXX]',
  ga4MeasurementId: 'G-[XXXXXXXXX]',

  // Pattern-Specific Variables
  // [Customize based on pattern requirements]
}
```

### Step 2.2: Customization Checklist by Pattern Type

#### A. Enhanced Ecommerce Pattern
```
□ Map product ID format (SKU, ID, custom)
□ Define product categories hierarchy
□ Set currency and tax configuration
□ Map checkout steps to client's funnel
□ Define refund/cancellation events
```

#### B. Form Analytics Pattern
```
□ Identify all forms (IDs, classes, names)
□ Map form fields to friendly names
□ Define success/error conditions
□ Set abandonment threshold (seconds)
□ Configure field interaction tracking
```

#### C. Virtual Page View Pattern
```
□ Identify route change mechanism
□ Map routes to page titles
□ Define page categories
□ Set history change detection
□ Configure title generation rules
```

#### D. Cookie Consent Pattern
```
□ Define consent categories needed
□ Map to client's consent tool
□ Set default consent state
□ Configure geographic rules
□ Define consent storage duration
```

### Step 2.3: Data Layer Specification

Create client-specific data layer spec:

```javascript
// Standard Data Layer Structure
dataLayer.push({
  'event': '[event_name]',
  'event_category': '[category]',
  'event_label': '[label]',
  'event_value': [numeric_value],

  // Client-Specific Extensions
  'client_property_1': '[value]',
  'client_property_2': '[value]',

  // Pattern Requirements
  '[pattern_specific_key]': '[pattern_specific_value]'
});
```

## Phase 3: Implementation Protocol

### Step 3.1: GTM Container Setup

**Container Preparation:**
```
1. [ ] Create/access GTM container
2. [ ] Set up folder structure:
   - /Tags/Patterns/
   - /Triggers/Patterns/
   - /Variables/Patterns/
3. [ ] Create workspace: "Pattern Implementation - [Date]"
4. [ ] Document existing tags (backup)
```

### Step 3.2: Pattern Deployment Sequence

**Correct Implementation Order:**
```
1. Cookie Consent (if needed) - FIRST, affects all others
2. Debug Mode - SECOND, helps test everything
3. User ID Sync - THIRD, enriches all data
4. Custom Dimensions - FOURTH, enhances context
5. Core Tracking Patterns - FIFTH (ecommerce, forms, etc.)
6. Enhancement Patterns - LAST (scroll, engagement, etc.)
```

### Step 3.3: Pattern Installation Steps

For each pattern:

```
1. [ ] Copy pattern code from library
2. [ ] Replace variables with client values
3. [ ] Create Custom HTML tag in GTM
4. [ ] Set appropriate trigger (DOM Ready, Page View, etc.)
5. [ ] Add pattern-specific Data Layer Variables
6. [ ] Create pattern-specific triggers
7. [ ] Build GA4 Event tags for pattern events
8. [ ] Test in GTM Preview Mode
9. [ ] Verify in GA4 DebugView
10. [ ] Document any customizations
```

### Step 3.4: Testing Protocol

**Level 1: GTM Preview Mode**
```
□ Pattern initializes without errors
□ Console shows expected logs
□ DataLayer receives events
□ Triggers fire correctly
□ Tags send to GA4
```

**Level 2: GA4 DebugView**
```
□ Events appear in real-time
□ Parameters are populated
□ User properties set correctly
□ No duplicate events
□ Timing is accurate
```

**Level 3: Production Verification**
```
□ Test on multiple devices
□ Test on different browsers
□ Verify mobile functionality
□ Check page speed impact
□ Monitor for JS errors
```
