## Core System Components & Solutions

### 1. Intake Form System
**Primary Recommendation: HubSpot Forms + Custom Properties**

**Why HubSpot:**
- Native form builder with advanced logic and conditional fields
- Built-in validation for email, URL, GTM container ID formats
- Automatic lead scoring and pipeline management
- GDPR/CCPA compliance built-in
- Seamless CRM integration (no additional sync needed)

**Configuration:**
```
Forms Required:
1. Initial Contact Form (basic qualification)
2. Discovery Intake Form (comprehensive - 40+ fields)
3. File Upload Form (using HubSpot's file upload field)
4. Technical Access Credentials Form (separate secure form)

Custom Properties Setup:
- Industry dropdown (15 predefined options)
- Website platform (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
- Current GTM/GA4 IDs with format validation
- Revenue range (dropdown with scoring)
- Ad spend range (dropdown with scoring)
```

**Alternative Solutions:**
- **Typeform Pro** ($85/month) - Better UX but limited CRM integration
- **Gravity Forms + WordPress** ($259/year) - Cost-effective but requires hosting

### 2. File Management & Document Storage
**Primary Recommendation: Airtable + Airtable Interfaces**

**Why Airtable:**
- Structured database perfect for client project tracking
- Built-in file attachments with version control
- Custom interfaces for client portals
- Powerful automation capabilities
- SOC 2 Type II compliant with encryption at rest

**Database Structure:**
```
Clients Table:
- Client ID (auto-generated)
- Company Name, Contact Info
- Project Status (Discovery, Implementation, Complete)
- Files Attached (native file fields)
- Access Credentials (encrypted text fields)

Projects Table:
- Project ID, Client ID (linked)
- Selected Patterns, Implementation Status
- Discovery Documents, Final Deliverables

Documents Table:
- Document Type (Discovery Report, Implementation Guide)
- Client ID (linked)
- Created Date, Version Number
- File Attachments
```

**Security Configuration:**
- Enterprise plan includes audit logs
- Role-based permissions for team access
- Client-specific interface views (portal functionality)
- Integration with Make.com for automated workflows

**Alternative Solutions:**
- **Box Business Plus** ($20/user/month) - Better security but limited database functionality
- **SharePoint + Power Automate** ($12.50/user/month) - Microsoft ecosystem but complexity overhead

### 3. Document Generation & Proposals
**Primary Recommendation: Make.com + Documint**

**Why This Combination:**
- Make.com provides workflow automation between all systems
- Documint specializes in PDF generation from templates
- Can pull data from Airtable and HubSpot automatically
- Generate discovery reports, proposals, and implementation guides

**Document Templates Needed:**
```
1. Discovery Call Summary Template
   - Client overview, high-level recommendations
   - NO specific implementation details
   - Generated from HubSpot contact properties

2. Discovery Proposal Template
   - $2,500-5,000 onboarding fee
   - What's included vs what comes after
   - Generated from intake form responses

3. Pattern Recommendation Report Template
   - 15-25 page comprehensive analysis
   - Custom pattern recommendations
   - ROI calculations and implementation roadmap
   - Generated from Airtable project data

4. Implementation Proposal Template
   - Final pricing based on selected patterns
   - Detailed timeline and resource requirements
   - Generated after discovery completion
```

**Workflow Automation:**
- Trigger: Discovery form completion → Generate discovery proposal
- Trigger: Payment received → Generate comprehensive analysis
- Trigger: Analysis complete → Generate implementation proposal

**Alternative Solutions:**
- **PandaDoc** ($49/month) - Better e-signature but limited templating
- **WebMerge** ($49/month) - Good templating but less automation

### 4. Payment Processing
**Primary Recommendation: Stripe + HubSpot Payments**

**Why Stripe:**
- Industry-standard payment processing (2.9% + 30¢)
- Native HubSpot integration available
- Supports one-time and recurring payments
- Comprehensive webhook system for automation
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliant

**Payment Workflows:**
```
Discovery Onboarding Process:
1. Client submits initial intake → Auto-generate discovery proposal
2. Discovery proposal sent via HubSpot with Stripe payment link
3. Payment confirmed → Trigger comprehensive intake form
4. Comprehensive form completed → Begin discovery analysis
5. Discovery complete → Generate implementation proposal
```

### 5. Workflow Automation Engine
**Primary Recommendation: Make.com (formerly Integromat)**

**Why Make.com:**
- Visual workflow builder (easier than Zapier for complex flows)
- Native integrations with HubSpot, Airtable, Stripe
- Advanced data transformation capabilities
- Competitive pricing: $10.59/month for 10,000 operations
- European company with strong privacy compliance

**Key Automated Workflows:**

**Workflow 1: Discovery Pipeline**
```
Trigger: New HubSpot contact from intake form
→ Check if qualified (budget > $5K)
→ If qualified: Send discovery proposal via email
→ If payment received: Create Airtable project record
→ Send comprehensive intake form
→ Set follow-up reminders
```

**Workflow 2: Document Generation**
```
Trigger: Discovery payment confirmed
→ Pull all client data from HubSpot + Airtable
→ Generate custom pattern analysis via Documint
→ Save to Airtable client folder
→ Send notification to delivery team
```

**Workflow 3: Implementation Decision**
```
Trigger: Implementation proposal sent
→ Set 30-day follow-up timer
→ If accepted: Create project in management system
→ If declined: Move to nurture sequence
→ Update project status in Airtable
```

**Alternative Solutions:**
- **Zapier** ($29.99/month) - More integrations but limited logic
- **Microsoft Power Automate** ($15/user/month) - Good for Microsoft stack
