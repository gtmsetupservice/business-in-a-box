üí° **Day 3: The $4,200 parameter mismatch (and why this happens more than you think)**

Remember yesterday's network payload that looked "perfect"?

Here's what I discovered when I compared it against the Google Ads account:

**Network Payload:**
- Conversion ID: 12345678
- Conversion Label: AbCdEfGhIj
- Account: 987-654-3210

**Google Ads Account Setup:**
- Conversion ID: 12345678 ‚úÖ
- Conversion Label: XyZaBcDeF ‚ùå
- Account: 987-654-3210 ‚úÖ

**Found it.**

The GTM tag was sending data to a conversion label that NO LONGER EXISTED.

The client had deleted and recreated the Google Ads conversion action (trying to "fix" it), which generated a NEW conversion label. But GTM was still referencing the old one.

**This exact pattern happens in 3 ways:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Conversion Action Recreation** - Delete/recreate generates new labels
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Multiple Ad Accounts** - Sending to Account A, checking Account B
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Plugin Conflicts** - WooCommerce/Site Kit auto-generates conflicting tags

Result: Perfect-looking setup, zero actual tracking.

3 weeks √ó $200/day = $4,200 in untracked spend.

But the REAL cost? Zero optimization data means campaigns get worse, not better.

Tomorrow: The systematic prevention framework.

Ever caught a parameter mismatch that looked like a platform bug?
