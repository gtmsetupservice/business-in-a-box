üö® **"No recent conversions" - The message that makes every Google Ads manager's stomach drop**

You've done everything right:
‚úÖ GTM container installed
‚úÖ Tags firing in debug mode
‚úÖ GA4 receiving purchase data perfectly

But Google Ads shows ZERO conversions.

This happened to my EdTech client last week. 5 years of Meta experience. Not a GTM rookie. But bleeding $200/day in ad spend with zero conversion tracking.

**Here's what most "experts" miss:**

They assume if GTM tags are firing = conversion tracking works.

WRONG.

GTM operates on 4 layers:
‚Üí Layer 1: Container Installation
‚Üí Layer 2: Tag Configuration
‚Üí Layer 3: Data Delivery ‚Üê This is where 90% of problems hide
‚Üí Layer 4: Platform Recognition

Most people stop checking at Layer 2. They see tags firing and think "we're good."

The real problems live in Layer 3 and beyond.

Tomorrow I'll share what the Network tab revealed that changed everything.

Have you ever seen "perfect" GTM setups that somehow don't track conversions?
