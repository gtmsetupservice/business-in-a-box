üéØ **Day 5: When "perfect" setups fail - professional lessons from the diagnostic trenches**

This case study represents something bigger than one broken conversion tag.

**The Pattern:**

Sophisticated business owners with real technical skills get stuck on problems that LOOK simple but require specialized diagnostic methodology.

**Layer 3 diagnostic skills most don't have time to develop:**
‚Üí Chrome DevTools network analysis
‚Üí Cross-platform configuration verification
‚Üí Payload inspection and validation
‚Üí Understanding how platforms process tracking data

**The Business Impact:**

Every day without proper conversion tracking = campaigns getting worse instead of better.

No conversion data means:
‚ùå Google can't optimize bids
‚ùå Can't identify high-performing keywords
‚ùå Can't improve campaign performance
‚ùå ROI decreases while spend increases

**When to DIY vs. Get Professional Help:**

If you see conversion tracking problems that persist despite "everything looking correct" in GTM, you're likely dealing with Layer 3 data delivery problems.

This isn't something you solve with YouTube tutorials or generic guides.

**My Diagnostic Approach:**

I specialize in Layer 3 problems that other consultants miss. Systematic methodology identifies exactly where tracking breaks down.

Most issues resolve in a single diagnostic call because I know where to look and what to verify.

**The Authority Flywheel Effect:**

Each diagnostic case ‚Üí Creates documented methodology ‚Üí Builds platform expertise ‚Üí Attracts similar challenges ‚Üí Reinforces authority

The more complex problems I solve, the more complex problems find me.

What's the most frustrating "simple" technical problem you've ever spent days solving?
