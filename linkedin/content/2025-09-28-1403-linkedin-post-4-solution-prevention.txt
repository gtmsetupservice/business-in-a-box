🛠️ **Day 4: The fix was simple. The prevention system is what matters.**

**The Fix:** Update GTM conversion tag with correct conversion label from current Google Ads conversion action.

5 minutes. Done.

**But here's what I learned that matters more:**

Layer 3 problems require systematic verification, not assumptions.

**My Prevention Framework:**

🔍 **Network Analysis** - Verify actual payloads being sent
🔄 **Cross-Platform Configuration Check** - Compare sending vs receiving setup
✅ **End-to-End Testing** - Test with small transactions, verify they appear correctly
📊 **Regular Auditing** - Monthly verification that tracking still works

**Why this matters:**

Business owners stop troubleshooting at the point where they can see "something happening" without verifying it's actually CORRECT.

Common false positives:
→ GTM tags firing = "Tracking works"
→ Network requests sending = "Data delivered"
→ Account receiving some data = "Setup complete"

Each can be false while appearing true.

**The Pattern I See Constantly:**

Smart business owners with technical skills hit Layer 3 problems and assume it's a platform issue, spending weeks troubleshooting the wrong layer.

Tomorrow: When to get professional help vs. DIY approach.

What's your biggest tracking assumption that turned out to be wrong?
