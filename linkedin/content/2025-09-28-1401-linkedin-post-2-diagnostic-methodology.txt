üîç **Day 2: What the Network tab revealed (and why 90% of consultants miss this)**

When I opened Chrome DevTools on my client's broken conversion tracking, here's what I found:

**Layer 1 ‚úÖ**: Container firing perfectly
**Layer 2 ‚úÖ**: All tags triggering in debug mode
**Layer 3 ‚ùå**: This is where everything fell apart

I pulled up the Network tab and triggered a purchase event:

```
POST https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/conversion/
Status: 200 OK
Payload: {
  "conversion_id": "12345678",
  "conversion_label": "AbCdEfGhIj",
  "value": 97.00,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

The network call was sending. The payload looked correct. Status 200 OK.

But still zero conversions in Google Ads.

**This is where most troubleshooting STOPS.**

People see data sending and assume it's a Google platform issue or "needs time to process."

But here's what separates real diagnostic expertise from guesswork:

**You cannot troubleshoot Layer 3 problems without comparing what's being SENT against what's EXPECTED on the receiving platform.**

Tomorrow: The parameter mismatch that was costing $200/day.

What's your go-to method for diagnosing tracking issues?
