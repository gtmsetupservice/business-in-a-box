# The 4-Layer GTM/GA4 Diagnostic Framework

**A systematic approach to troubleshooting Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics 4 tracking issues**

---

## Why This Framework Exists

Most GTM troubleshooting is chaotic. People jump between tools, check random things, and waste hours hunting for problems.

**This framework gives you a systematic method:**
1. Identify which layer the problem exists in
2. Use the right diagnostic tools for that layer
3. Fix the issue efficiently

**The result?** What used to take 3 hours now takes 20 minutes.

---

## The 4 Layers

Every GTM/GA4 implementation has exactly 4 layers. Data must successfully pass through all 4 layers to appear in your reports.

```
Layer 1: Infrastructure    → Can GTM even load?
Layer 2: Implementation     → Are tags configured correctly?
Layer 3: Transmission       → Is data leaving the browser?
Layer 4: Processing         → Is GA4 displaying the data?
```

**Critical concept:** Problems cascade down but not up.
- If Layer 1 fails → Everything fails
- If Layer 2 fails → Layers 3-4 never happen
- If Layer 3 fails → Layer 4 never receives data
- If Layer 4 fails → Data was collected but won't appear in reports

---

## How To Use This Framework

### Three Diagnostic Approaches

**1. Bottom-Up (Start at Layer 1)**
- Use when: Complete tracking failure, nothing works
- Process: Verify Layer 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 until you find the break

**2. Top-Down (Start at Layer 4)**
- Use when: Data flows but looks wrong (wrong values, missing dimensions)
- Process: Check Layer 4 settings → 3 → 2 until you find the misconfiguration

**3. Meet-in-the-Middle**
- Use when: Complex issues or you're unsure where to start
- Process: Check Layers 2 and 3 simultaneously (GTM Preview + Network tab)

---

## Quick Symptom Reference

**"I see nothing in GA4 at all"**
→ Start at Layer 1 (Infrastructure)

**"GTM Preview shows tags firing, but no data in GA4"**
→ Check Layer 3 (Transmission) - likely blocked by ad blocker or firewall

**"Data in DebugView but not in reports"**
→ Check Layer 4 (Processing) - custom dimensions not registered or data thresholding

**"Wrong values in reports"**
→ Check Layer 2 (Implementation) - dataLayer or variable configuration issue

**"Works for me but not for clients"**
→ Check Layer 3 (Transmission) - browser extension or network interference

**"Events arrive but parameters missing"**
→ Check Layer 2 (Implementation) → Layer 4 (Processing) - parameter mapping or registration

---

# LAYER 1: Infrastructure

## What This Layer Covers

The **physical loading** of Google Tag Manager on your website. If this layer fails, nothing else can happen.

**The Question:** Can the GTM container JavaScript file load and execute?

## Components At This Layer

### GTM Components
- GTM container snippet in HTML `<head>` section
- `gtm.js` file loading from `googletagmanager.com` (must return HTTP 200)
- `<noscript>` fallback iframe for non-JavaScript browsers
- Correct container version downloading from Google's CDN

### External Dependencies
- **Consent Management Platform (CMP):** Can block GTM from loading until user grants consent
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) headers:** Can block external scripts
- **CORS policies:** Can prevent cross-origin script execution
- **SSL/TLS certificates:** Can cause mixed content blocking

### GA4 Components
- None (GA4 doesn't exist until GTM loads it in Layer 2)

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic

### Step 1: Verify GTM Snippet Exists
**Tool:** Browser DevTools → Elements tab

1. Right-click page → "Inspect"
2. Press `Cmd+F` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F` (Windows)
3. Search for: `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-`
4. **Success:** You see the snippet in `<head>` section
5. **Failure:** Snippet missing or in wrong location (body instead of head)

**Common Issue #1: Snippet Installed in Theme That Gets Overwritten**
- **Symptom:** GTM works, then stops after theme update
- **Fix:** Install GTM via plugin or child theme

**Common Issue #2: Multiple GTM Snippets (Different Container IDs)**
- **Symptom:** Unpredictable behavior, some tags fire twice
- **Fix:** Remove duplicate snippets, use only one container

### Step 2: Verify gtm.js Loads Successfully
**Tool:** Browser DevTools → Network tab

1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Filter by "gtm" or "googletagmanager"
4. Find `gtm.js?id=GTM-XXXXXXX` request
5. **Success:** Status code = 200 (or 304 if cached)
6. **Failure:** Status code = 4xx, 5xx, or request blocked/red

**Common Issue #3: Ad Blocker Removing GTM Snippet**
- **Symptom:** gtm.js request never appears in Network tab
- **Diagnostic:** View page source (Cmd+U) vs rendered HTML (Elements tab) - snippet exists in source but not rendered
- **Fix:** Can't fix for users with ad blockers (see Layer 3 for server-side solution)

**Common Issue #4: Content Security Policy (CSP) Blocking GTM**
- **Symptom:** Console error: "Refused to load script from googletagmanager.com"
- **Diagnostic:** Check Console for CSP errors
- **Fix:** Add `script-src googletagmanager.com` to CSP header

**Common Issue #5: Consent Banner Blocking GTM**
- **Symptom:** gtm.js doesn't load until user accepts cookies
- **Diagnostic:** Click "Accept All" and see if gtm.js loads
- **Fix:** This is often intentional; implement Consent Mode (see Consent section)

### Step 3: Verify GTM Container Initializes
**Tool:** Browser DevTools → Console

1. Open Console tab
2. Type: `google_tag_manager`
3. **Success:** You see an object with your GTM container ID
4. **Failure:** `undefined` or not found

```javascript
// What success looks like:
google_tag_manager['GTM-XXXXXX']
// Returns: {dataLayer: dataLayerObject, gtmHasInitialized: true}
```

**Common Issue #6: JavaScript Error Before GTM Loads**
- **Symptom:** Red errors in Console before gtm.js loads
- **Diagnostic:** Other scripts throwing errors and blocking GTM execution
- **Fix:** Fix the earlier JavaScript error or move GTM snippet higher in `<head>`

## Tools Summary (Layer 1)

| Tool | What To Check | Success Indicator |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Elements tab | GTM snippet exists | Snippet visible in `<head>` |
| Network tab | gtm.js loads | Status 200 or 304 |
| Console | No loading errors | No red errors, `google_tag_manager` defined |
| View Source (Cmd+U) | Snippet in original HTML | Present in source code |

## When To Stop & Move To Layer 2

✅ gtm.js loads with status 200
✅ No Console errors related to GTM
✅ `google_tag_manager` object exists in Console

**If all three are true, the problem is NOT in Layer 1. Move to Layer 2.**

---

# LAYER 2: Implementation

## What This Layer Covers

The **configuration inside Google Tag Manager** - your tags, triggers, variables, and dataLayer logic.

**The Question:** Are your tags configured to fire at the right time with the right data?

## Components At This Layer

### GTM Components
- **Tags:** GA4 Configuration, GA4 Events, custom HTML, third-party tags
- **Triggers:** When tags should fire (page views, clicks, form submits, custom events)
- **Variables:** Where tags get their data (dataLayer variables, DOM elements, JavaScript)
- **Tag Sequencing:** Setup tags, cleanup tags, trigger exceptions
- **Folder Organization:** Logical grouping (doesn't affect functionality but helps debugging)

### Data Layer
- **Structure:** JavaScript array containing event objects
- **Timing:** Must be pushed BEFORE triggers evaluate
- **Content:** Event names and parameters

### GA4 Components (Configured In GTM)
- **Measurement ID:** G-XXXXXXXXXX identifier
- **Event Parameters:** Mapped from dataLayer to GA4 (e.g., `{{dlv - transactionId}}` → `transaction_id`)
- **User Properties:** Set via GA4 Configuration tag
- **Custom Dimensions/Metrics:** Parameters sent from GTM (must also be registered in GA4 UI - Layer 4)

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic

### Step 1: Launch GTM Preview Mode
**Tool:** Google Tag Manager Preview Mode

1. In GTM, click "Preview" button (top right)
2. Enter your website URL
3. New window opens with "Tag Assistant Connected" banner
4. **Success:** Tag Assistant panel appears showing events
5. **Failure:** "Unable to connect" or no banner appears

**Common Issue #7: Preview Mode Won't Connect**
- **Symptom:** "Connection failed" or times out
- **Causes:**
  - Browser extension blocking connection
  - Corporate firewall blocking Tag Assistant
  - Third-party cookies disabled
  - Different browser profile (GTM logged into Profile A, testing in Profile B)
- **Fix:** Disable extensions, use Incognito mode, or try different browser

### Step 2: Verify Tags Fire
**Tool:** Tag Assistant Timeline

1. In Tag Assistant, click through events (Page View, click, etc.)
2. Expand each event to see tags
3. **Success:** Tags show green "Succeeded"
4. **Failure:** Tags show:
   - Gray "Not Fired" (trigger conditions not met)
   - Orange "Failed" (tag execution error)
   - Red "Error" (JavaScript error in tag)

**Common Issue #8: Trigger Conditions Not Met**
- **Symptom:** Tag shows "Not Fired" every time
- **Diagnostic:** Click tag → view "Trigger" section → see which conditions failed
- **Example:** Click trigger requires `Click Element` matches `.buy-button` but actual element is `.purchase-button`
- **Fix:** Adjust trigger conditions to match reality

**Common Issue #9: Tag Fires But Wrong Data**
- **Symptom:** Tag fires but sends empty/wrong parameters
- **Diagnostic:** Click tag → view "Data" section → see variable values
- **Example:** `{{dlv - product_name}}` shows `undefined` because dataLayer uses `productName` not `product_name`
- **Fix:** Update variable to match actual dataLayer structure

### Step 3: Inspect Data Layer
**Tool:** Tag Assistant Variables tab + Browser Console

**Method 1: Tag Assistant (Easiest)**
1. Click any event in Tag Assistant
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Scroll to "Data Layer Variables"
4. **Success:** Your variables show expected values
5. **Failure:** Variables show `undefined`, `null`, or wrong values

**Method 2: Browser Console (Most Accurate)**
1. Open Console
2. Type: `dataLayer`
3. Expand array to see all pushed objects

```javascript
// Example of properly structured dataLayer
dataLayer = [
  {event: 'gtm.js', gtm.start: 1234567890},
  {event: 'page_view', page_title: 'Home'},
  {event: 'add_to_cart',
   ecommerce: {
     currency: 'USD',
     value: 29.99,
     items: [{item_name: 'Blue Widget'}]
   }
  }
]
```

**Common Issue #10: dataLayer.push Happens AFTER Trigger Fires**
- **Symptom:** Variables are undefined in first pageview but work on subsequent pages
- **Cause:** Timing - GTM fires Page View trigger before your dataLayer.push executes
- **Diagnostic:**
  1. View page source (Cmd+U)
  2. Find dataLayer.push location
  3. Is it AFTER the GTM snippet? (Wrong)
  4. Is it in async JavaScript? (Wrong)
- **Fix:** Move dataLayer.push BEFORE GTM snippet or use Custom Event trigger instead of Page View

**Common Issue #11: Incorrect dataLayer Structure**
- **Symptom:** dataLayer exists but variables can't read it
- **Wrong:**
```javascript
dataLayer.push(['event', 'purchase']) // Array instead of object
```
- **Correct:**
```javascript
dataLayer.push({event: 'purchase'}) // Object
```

### Step 4: Check Variable Values
**Tool:** Tag Assistant Variables Tab

1. Select an event
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Check both:
   - **Built-In Variables** (Page URL, Page Path, Click Element, etc.)
   - **User-Defined Variables** (your custom variables)
4. **Success:** Variables show expected values
5. **Failure:** Variables show undefined, null, or unexpected values

**Common Issue #12: Variable Uses Wrong Getter Method**
- **Example:** Trying to read `dataLayer.ecommerce.value`
- **Wrong Configuration:** Variable type = "JavaScript Variable" with name `dataLayer.ecommerce.value`
- **Fix:** Variable type = "Data Layer Variable" with name `ecommerce.value`

### Step 5: Test Edge Cases
**Critical Tests:**
1. First pageview (when page first loads)
2. Second pageview (internal navigation, SPA)
3. Click tracking (various click types)
4. Form submit (both success and error states)
5. Scroll tracking (if implemented)

**Common Issue #13: Works On Page 1, Breaks On Page 2 (SPA Issue)**
- **Symptom:** Tags fire correctly on initial load but not on subsequent navigation
- **Cause:** Single Page Application (SPA) doesn't do full page reload
- **Diagnostic:** Check if Page View trigger uses "DOM Ready" vs "History Change"
- **Fix:** Use History Change trigger or implement custom SPA tracking

## Tools Summary (Layer 2)

| Tool | What To Check | Success Indicator |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| GTM Preview Mode | Tags fire | Green "Succeeded" status |
| Tag Assistant Variables | Variable values | Expected values, not undefined |
| Console → dataLayer | Data structure | Objects properly formatted |
| Tag Assistant Timeline | Event sequence | Events fire in correct order |

## When To Stop & Move To Layer 3

✅ GTM Preview shows tags firing with green "Succeeded" status
✅ Variables show correct values in Tag Assistant
✅ dataLayer contains expected data

**If all three are true, the problem is NOT in Layer 2. Move to Layer 3.**

---

# LAYER 3: Transmission

## What This Layer Covers

The **successful transmission** of data from the user's browser to Google's servers (or your server-side GTM endpoint).

**The Question:** Is data leaving the browser and arriving at its destination?

**This is where most "invisible" failures happen.** Tags fire correctly (Layer 2 ✅) but data never reaches Google (Layer 3 ❌).

## Components At This Layer

### The Exit Point

**Client-Side Implementation:**
```
GTM Tag Fires → Creates HTTP Request → Sends to google-analytics.com/g/collect
```

**Server-Side Implementation:**
```
GTM Tag Fires → Sends to your-domain.com/sgtm-endpoint → Your server sends to google-analytics.com/g/collect
```

### What Can Block Transmission

**Browser-Level Blocking:**
- Ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, Privacy Badger)
- Browser privacy features (Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection, Brave Shields)
- Privacy extensions (Ghostery, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials)

**Network-Level Blocking:**
- Corporate firewalls
- VPN with ad blocking
- DNS-based blockers (Pi-hole, NextDNS)
- ISP throttling/blocking

**Technical Issues:**
- Mixed content warnings (HTTP page trying to send HTTPS request)
- CORS errors (rare with Google's endpoints)
- Request size too large (>8KB for GET requests)

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic

### Step 1: Open Network Tab & Filter
**Tool:** Browser DevTools → Network tab

1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. **Clear any existing requests** (trash icon)
3. In filter box, type: `collect` or `google-analytics`
4. Trigger the event (click, page view, etc.)
5. **Success:** You see new request(s) appear
6. **Failure:** No requests appear at all

**What success looks like:**
```
Request: https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-XXXXXXXXX&en=page_view&...
Status: 204 No Content (or 200 OK)
```

**Common Issue #14: No Collect Requests Appear At All**
- **Symptom:** Network tab shows zero collect requests even though GTM Preview shows tags firing
- **Cause:** Ad blocker or privacy extension
- **Diagnostic:**
  1. Disable ALL browser extensions
  2. Retry
  3. If requests now appear, an extension was blocking
- **Fix:** Can't fix for end users; see server-side GTM solution below

**Common Issue #15: Request Appears But Status = Failed (Red)**
- **Symptom:** Collect request in Network tab but shows "Failed" or "Blocked"
- **Cause:** Firewall, DNS blocker, or network policy
- **Diagnostic:** Check if you're on corporate network, VPN, or have system-wide ad blocker
- **Fix:** For testing, disconnect from VPN; for production, use server-side GTM

### Step 2: Inspect Request Status Code
**Tool:** Network tab → Click request → Headers

1. Click the collect request in Network tab
2. View "Status Code"
3. **Success:**
   - `204 No Content` (most common)
   - `200 OK` (also valid)
4. **Partial Failure:**
   - `302 Found` (redirect, check redirect destination)
   - `3xx` (other redirects)
5. **Failure:**
   - `4xx` (client error - bad request format)
   - `5xx` (server error - Google's servers temporarily down, very rare)
   - `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` (ad blocker)
   - `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` (DNS blocking google-analytics.com)

**Common Issue #16: Status = net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT**
- **Cause:** Ad blocker at browser, extension, or DNS level
- **Cannot Fix:** For end users with ad blockers
- **Business Impact:** You lose 15-45% of your traffic data depending on audience
- **Solution:** Implement server-side GTM

### Step 3: Inspect Request Payload
**Tool:** Network tab → Click request → Payload tab

Critical parameters to verify:

| Parameter | Purpose | Example Value |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `v` | Protocol version | `2` (for GA4) |
| `tid` | Measurement ID | `G-XXXXXXXXX` |
| `en` | Event name | `page_view`, `add_to_cart` |
| `cid` | Client ID | `1234567890.9876543210` |
| `dl` | Document Location | `https://yoursite.com/page` |
| `dt` | Document Title | `Page Title` |
| Custom params | Your event parameters | `ep.product_name=Blue%20Widget` |

**Common Issue #17: Measurement ID (tid) Wrong or Missing**
- **Symptom:** Requests sent but data goes to wrong GA4 property (or nowhere)
- **Diagnostic:** Check `tid` parameter - is it YOUR G-XXXXXXXXX ID?
- **Cause:** GA4 Configuration tag has wrong Measurement ID
- **Fix:** Update Measurement ID in GTM tag (back to Layer 2)

**Common Issue #18: Critical Parameters Missing**
- **Symptom:** Request sent but missing `cid`, `en`, or other required parameters
- **Cause:** Tag configuration error in Layer 2
- **Fix:** Go back to Layer 2, check tag configuration

### Step 4: Test With Ad Blocker Disabled
**Critical Test for Production Sites**

1. **Test 1:** Use your normal browser (with extensions)
   - Record how many collect requests you see
2. **Test 2:** Use Incognito/Private window (no extensions)
   - Record how many collect requests you see
3. **Compare:** Incognito should show MORE requests

**If Incognito shows requests but normal browser doesn't:**
- You've confirmed browser extension blocking
- This is what 15-45% of your users experience
- Consider server-side GTM to solve this

### Step 5: Understand Server-Side GTM

**The Problem Server-Side GTM Solves:**
- Ad blockers can't block requests to YOUR domain
- Corporate firewalls don't block your domain
- Browser privacy features can't block first-party requests

**How It Works:**
```
Before (Client-Side):
Browser → google-analytics.com ❌ (Blocked)

After (Server-Side):
Browser → your-domain.com/sgtm ✅ (Allowed)
         → Your server → google-analytics.com ✅ (From server, not blocked)
```

**When You Need Server-Side GTM:**
- You're losing >20% of traffic to ad blockers
- You sell to enterprises (corporate firewalls block tracking)
- You need consent-compliant first-party data
- Privacy is a competitive advantage
- You want maximum data accuracy

**Common Issue #19: Server-Side Endpoint Not Responding**
- **Symptom:** Request sent to your server-side endpoint but times out or fails
- **Diagnostic:** Check endpoint URL in Network tab - does it return 204?
- **Causes:**
  - SSL certificate error on server-side domain
  - Server-side GTM container not running (Google Cloud, Stape, etc.)
  - DNS not configured correctly
- **Fix:** Verify server-side GTM infrastructure is running and accessible

## Tools Summary (Layer 3)

| Tool | What To Check | Success Indicator |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Network tab | Requests sent | Collect requests visible |
| Status codes | Successful delivery | 204 or 200 status |
| Payload inspection | Data present | Required parameters included |
| Incognito test | Blocking comparison | More requests without extensions |

## When To Stop & Move To Layer 4

✅ Collect requests appear in Network tab
✅ Status codes = 204 or 200
✅ Payload contains expected parameters

**If all three are true, the problem is NOT in Layer 3. Move to Layer 4.**

# LAYER 4: Processing

## What This Layer Covers

How **Google Analytics 4 receives, processes, and displays** the data it received. GTM's job is done - this is entirely GA4's domain.

**The Question:** Is GA4 properly configured to display the data it's receiving?

**Critical Insight:** Data can successfully reach GA4 (Layer 3 ✅) but still not appear in reports due to GA4 configuration issues.

## Components At This Layer

### GA4 Configuration (In GA4 UI, NOT GTM)

**Property Settings:**
- Data Streams (website, app)
- Data Filters (internal traffic, developer traffic)
- Data Retention (2 months vs 14 months)
- Reporting Identity (Blended, Observed, Device-based)
- Google Signals (on/off - affects thresholding)

**Custom Definitions:**
- Custom Dimensions (event-scoped, user-scoped)
- Custom Metrics (numeric values)
- **Critical:** Must be registered to appear in reports

**Conversions:**
- Which events count as conversions
- Affects reporting and attribution

**Audiences:**
- User segments for analysis and remarketing

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic

### Step 1: Verify Data Reaches GA4 DebugView
**Tool:** GA4 → Reports → Realtime → DebugView

**How to Enable Debug Mode:**
**Method 1: GTM Preview Mode (Automatic)**
- When GTM Preview is active, debug mode is automatically enabled
- DebugView shows events immediately

**Method 2: Manual Debug Parameter**
- Add `?_gl=debug` to URL (deprecated, use GTM Preview instead)

**Steps:**
1. Open GA4 → Reports → Realtime → DebugView
2. In GTM Preview, trigger an event
3. Within 1-5 seconds, event should appear in DebugView
4. **Success:** Event appears with all parameters
5. **Failure:** Event doesn't appear at all

**Common Issue #20: DebugView Shows Nothing**
- **Symptom:** Events not appearing in DebugView despite successful transmission (Layer 3 ✅)
- **Diagnostic:** Check these in order:
  1. Are you looking at the correct GA4 property? (check Measurement ID)
  2. Is Debug mode actually enabled? (check GTM Preview is active)
  3. Is your IP address filtered in Data Filters? (settings → Data collection → Data filters)
- **Fix:** Disable internal traffic filter temporarily, verify correct property

**Common Issue #21: Event Appears But Parameters Missing**
- **Symptom:** Event visible in DebugView but key parameters show as `(not set)`
- **Diagnostic:**
  1. Click event in DebugView
  2. Scroll to "Parameters" section
  3. Are parameters present but with `(not set)` values?
  4. Or are parameters completely missing?
- **If parameters missing:** Problem is in Layer 2 (not sending parameters) or Layer 3 (parameters stripped)
- **If parameters show (not set):** Problem is GA4 not receiving the data properly

### Step 2: Check Custom Dimensions Are Registered
**Tool:** GA4 → Admin → Custom Definitions

**The #1 Most Common Layer 4 Issue:**
Data flows perfectly through Layers 1-3, appears in DebugView, but **doesn't show up in reports**.

**Why?** Custom dimensions must be **explicitly registered** in GA4 before they appear in reports.

**Steps:**
1. GA4 → Admin (bottom left) → Custom Definitions → Custom dimensions
2. Check if your parameter is registered
3. **If not registered:**
   - Click "Create custom dimension"
   - Dimension name: (how it appears in reports) `Product Name`
   - Scope: `Event` (usually) or `User`
   - Event parameter: `product_name` (must match EXACTLY what you send from GTM)
   - Click "Save"
4. **Wait 24-48 hours** for historical data to be processed with new dimension

**Common Issue #22: Dimension Registered But Still Shows (not set)**
- **Symptom:** Dimension registered in GA4 but reports show all values as `(not set)`
- **Causes:**
  1. **Parameter name mismatch:** GTM sends `productName` but GA4 dimension expects `product_name`
  2. **Scope mismatch:** Dimension registered as "User" scope but parameter sent with events (should be "Event" scope)
  3. **Not sent with every event:** Dimension only sent on some events, shows (not set) on others
  4. **Recently registered:** Takes 24-48 hours for dimension to populate
- **Fix:** Verify exact parameter name match between GTM and GA4 registration

**Dimension Limits:**
- Event-scoped custom dimensions: 50 per property (free), 125 (360)
- User-scoped custom dimensions: 25 per property (free), 100 (360)

### Step 3: Check Data Filters
**Tool:** GA4 → Admin → Data Settings → Data Filters

**What Data Filters Do:**
Block specific traffic from appearing in reports (though it still appears in DebugView)

**Common Filters:**
- Internal Traffic (your office IP addresses)
- Developer Traffic (marked by debug_mode parameter)
- Unwanted Referrals (remove spam)

**Steps:**
1. GA4 → Admin → Data Settings → Data Filters
2. Check if any filters are "Active"
3. Check if your test traffic matches filter rules

**Common Issue #23: Data In DebugView But Not Realtime/Reports**
- **Symptom:** Events visible in DebugView but missing from Realtime and Standard reports
- **Cause:** Your traffic matches an active Data Filter
- **Diagnostic:**
  1. Check your IP address: Google "what is my IP"
  2. Check Data Filters for "Internal Traffic" filter
  3. Does filter include your IP range?
- **Fix:**
  - For testing: Set filter to "Testing" (shows filter status but doesn't exclude)
  - For production: Verify filters correctly identify internal vs customer traffic

### Step 4: Understand Reporting Delays
**GA4 Has Three Types of Reports:**

| Report Type | Latency | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| DebugView | Real-time (1-5 sec) | Debugging, testing |
| Realtime Reports | Near real-time (60 sec) | Monitor current activity |
| Standard Reports | 24-48 hours | Analysis, business decisions |

**Common Issue #24: "My Data Disappeared"**
- **Symptom:** Data was in Realtime report yesterday, but today's Standard reports don't show it
- **Not Actually an Issue:** This is expected behavior
- **Explanation:**
  - Realtime reports show last 30 minutes
  - Standard reports take 24-48 hours to populate
  - The gap between them causes confusion
- **Fix:** Wait 24-48 hours, data will appear

### Step 5: Understand Data Thresholding
**What Is Thresholding?**
GA4 automatically hides data in reports when user counts are too low to protect user privacy.

**When Thresholding Happens:**
- Google Signals is enabled (cross-device tracking)
- Report segment has <50 users (approximately)
- Trying to view detailed dimensions with small sample sizes

**What You See:**
- Reports show `(thresholded)` or data is missing
- DebugView shows full data
- BigQuery (if connected) shows full data

**Common Issue #25: Data In DebugView But Reports Show (thresholded)**
- **Symptom:** Events tracked correctly but reports show thresholded message or no data
- **Cause:** Low traffic volume + Google Signals enabled
- **Diagnostic:**
  1. GA4 → Admin → Data Settings → Data collection
  2. Check if "Google signals data collection" is ON
  3. Check your property's daily user count
- **Temporary Fix:** Disable Google Signals (loses cross-device tracking)
- **Real Solution:** Wait for more traffic, or accept data won't show for low-volume segments

### Step 6: Verify Measurement ID Matches
**Critical Final Check**

If data seems to be going somewhere but not YOUR property:

1. **In GTM:** Check GA4 Configuration tag Measurement ID
2. **In Network Tab:** Check `tid` parameter in collect request
3. **In GA4:** Admin → Data Streams → Web → View Measurement ID

**All three must match exactly.**

**Common Issue #26: Data Going To Wrong Property**
- **Symptom:** DebugView empty, but you know tags fire and requests send
- **Cause:** Measurement ID in GTM points to different GA4 property (dev vs prod, old vs new)
- **Diagnostic:** Compare Measurement IDs from GTM tag, Network payload, and GA4 property
- **Fix:** Update GTM tag with correct Measurement ID

## Tools Summary (Layer 4)

| Tool | What To Check | Success Indicator |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| DebugView | Data arrives at GA4 | Events visible with parameters |
| Custom Definitions | Dimensions registered | All parameters registered |
| Data Filters | Traffic not blocked | Filters set to "Testing" mode |
| Standard Reports (wait 24-48hrs) | Final data | Events and dimensions appear |

## When You've Fixed It

✅ Events appear in DebugView with all parameters
✅ Custom dimensions registered in GA4 Admin
✅ Data Filters don't block your traffic
✅ (After 24-48 hours) Data appears in Standard Reports

**If all four are true, Layer 4 is working correctly.**

# CONSENT MODE: The Fifth Dimension

## Why Consent Deserves Its Own Section

Consent affects **all four layers** differently. Most troubleshooting guides ignore consent, but it's becoming the #1 cause of tracking failures in 2024-2025.

**The Reality:**
- GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws require user consent
- Without consent, most tracking is illegal
- Consent Mode allows some tracking even when consent is denied
- Understanding consent is your competitive advantage

## How Consent Affects Each Layer

### Layer 1: Infrastructure + Consent

**What Changes:**
- Consent banner must load BEFORE GTM (usually)
- Or consent state must be set via default `gtag` consent call
- Without consent granted, CMP can block GTM from loading entirely

**Common Consent + Layer 1 Issue:**
- **Symptom:** GTM doesn't load at all until user clicks "Accept"
- **Diagnostic:** Check if consent banner JavaScript loads before GTM snippet
- **Expected Behavior:** This is often intentional (blocking mode)
- **Solution:** Implement Consent Mode properly so GTM loads but waits for consent signals

**Proper Consent Mode Implementation (Layer 1):**
```html
<!-- BEFORE GTM snippet -->
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}

  // Set default consent to 'denied' for all types
  gtag('consent', 'default', {
    'ad_storage': 'denied',
    'analytics_storage': 'denied',
    'functionality_storage': 'denied',
    'personalization_storage': 'denied',
    'security_storage': 'granted'
  });
</script>
<!-- NOW GTM can load -->
<!-- Google Tag Manager snippet here -->
```

### Layer 2: Implementation + Consent

**What Changes:**
- Tags must check consent status before firing
- GTM has built-in "Consent Settings" for each tag
- Different tags require different consent types

**Tag Consent Requirements:**

| Tag Type | Requires | Consent Type |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| GA4 Configuration | Analytics | analytics_storage |
| GA4 Events | Analytics | analytics_storage |
| Google Ads Conversion | Marketing | ad_storage |
| Facebook Pixel | Marketing | ad_storage |
| Hotjar/Session Recording | Functionality | functionality_storage |

**Configuring Tag Consent (In GTM):**
1. Open tag in GTM
2. Advanced Settings → Consent Settings
3. Select "Require additional consent for tag to fire"
4. Check required consent types (e.g., "Analytics Storage")
5. Save

**Common Consent + Layer 2 Issue:**
- **Symptom:** GTM Preview shows tag "Not Fired - Consent Not Granted"
- **Diagnostic:**
  1. In GTM Preview, check "Consent" tab
  2. See current consent state (granted/denied for each type)
  3. Compare to tag's consent requirements
- **Fix:** Either:
  - Grant consent in your test (click "Accept All" in banner)
  - Or adjust tag's consent requirements

**Testing Consent States:**
1. Load page → Check initial consent (should be "denied")
2. Click "Accept All" → Check updated consent (should be "granted")
3. Verify tags fire after consent granted
4. Test "Reject All" → Verify tags DON'T fire (or fire in consent mode)

### Layer 3: Transmission + Consent

**What Changes:**
- Even when consent denied, Consent Mode sends signals to GA4
- Different payload depending on consent state

**Client-Side With Consent Granted:**
```
Full data sent: user ID, client ID, page path, all event parameters
```

**Client-Side With Consent Denied (Consent Mode Active):**
```
Limited data sent: consent state signals, cookieless pings
No cookies set, no client ID persistence
```

**Server-Side With Consent Mode:**
```
Browser sends consent state to your server
Your server decides what to forward to Google
Enables first-party data collection with consent compliance
```

**Common Consent + Layer 3 Issue:**
- **Symptom:** Requests sent but with very limited data (no client ID, no user data)
- **Diagnostic:** Check Network tab payload - do you see consent parameters?
  - `gcs=G100` (consent state parameter)
  - Very short payload compared to normal
- **Explanation:** This is working as designed - Consent Mode is active
- **Not a Bug:** GA4 receives consent signals and models conversions

### Layer 4: Processing + Consent

**What Changes:**
- GA4 uses consent signals for conversion modeling
- Reports show modeled data when consent denied
- Data quality depends on consent rate

**Conversion Modeling:**
When consent denied, GA4 uses machine learning to estimate:
- How many conversions would have happened
- Which channels drove them
- Estimated conversion value

**Modeling Requirements:**
- At least 1,000 events per day with consent granted
- Minimum consent rate: ~40-60% (Google doesn't publish exact number)
- 7 days of data for model training

**Common Consent + Layer 4 Issue:**
- **Symptom:** Reports show "Modeled" badge on metrics
- **Diagnostic:** Check consent grant rate in GA4
  1. GA4 → Admin → Data display
  2. Check "Reporting identity" setting
- **This is working correctly:** Modeling fills data gaps from denied consent
- **To see only observed data:** Filter reports to "Observed only" (loses some data accuracy)

## Consent Mode v2 (Required March 2024+)

**What Changed:**
Google now requires TWO additional consent types for ads:
- `ad_user_data` (previously part of ad_storage)
- `ad_personalization` (previously part of ad_storage)

**Updated Default Consent:**
```javascript
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'ad_storage': 'denied',
  'ad_user_data': 'denied',           // NEW
  'ad_personalization': 'denied',     // NEW
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',
  'functionality_storage': 'denied',
  'personalization_storage': 'denied',
  'security_storage': 'granted'
});
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Without v2 signals, Google Ads/Meta conversions won't be attributed correctly
- EU users especially affected
- Consent Mode v2 required for ads to run in EU

## Server-Side GTM + Consent Mode = Your Competitive Advantage

**The Problem:**
- 15-45% of users have ad blockers (Layer 3 blocking)
- Privacy regulations require consent (all layers)
- Traditional tracking breaks without cookies

**The Solution:**
Server-side GTM + proper Consent Mode implementation

**Benefits:**
1. **Ad Blocker Proof:** Data flows to YOUR domain (not blocked)
2. **Consent Compliant:** Proper consent signals sent
3. **First-Party Data:** Cookies set on your domain
4. **Maximum Data Quality:** 90%+ of traffic tracked (vs 55-85% client-side)
5. **Future-Proof:** Works in cookieless future

**This Is What You Sell:**
Not just "GTM setup" but "consent-compliant first-party data strategy with server-side implementation."

**Most GTM consultants can't do this.** You can.

---

## "Nothing Works" Emergency Diagnostic

**Symptom:** Zero data in GA4, complete tracking failure

**Time: 10 minutes**

### Step 1: Verify GTM Exists (2 min)
```
1. View page source (Cmd+U or Ctrl+U)
2. Search for "googletagmanager.com"
3. Is GTM snippet present?
```

**NOT PRESENT:**
- Problem: GTM not installed
- Fix: Install GTM snippet in `<head>` section

**PRESENT:** Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Verify GTM Loads (2 min)
```
1. DevTools → Network tab
2. Refresh page
3. Filter for "gtm"
4. Does gtm.js load?
```

**NOT LOADING:**
- Check Console for errors
- Check if ad blocker is active (try Incognito)
- Check CSP headers

**LOADING:** Continue to Step 3

### Step 3: Check GTM Container (2 min)
```
1. GTM → Workspace
2. Check "Triggers" - are any triggers set up?
3. Check "Tags" - is GA4 Configuration tag present?
4. Check tag's Measurement ID - is it correct?
```

**NO TAGS/TRIGGERS:**
- Problem: Empty GTM container
- Fix: Configure tags and triggers

**TAGS EXIST:** Continue to Step 4

### Step 4: Test In Preview Mode (3 min)
```
1. GTM → Preview
2. Load your website
3. Does Tag Assistant connect?
4. Do tags fire?
```

**TAG ASSISTANT WON'T CONNECT:**
- Try different browser
- Disable browser extensions
- Try Incognito mode

**TAGS DON'T FIRE:**
- Check trigger conditions
- Check consent settings
- View tag's "Not Fired" reasons

**TAGS FIRE:** Continue to Step 5

### Step 5: Check Data Reaches GA4 (1 min)
```
1. GA4 → DebugView
2. With Preview active, trigger event
3. Does event appear?
```

**NO:**
- Check Measurement ID matches in GTM and GA4
- Check Network tab for collect requests
- Check if blocked by ad blocker

**YES:**
- Wait 24-48 hours for Standard Reports
- Problem was likely just reporting delay

## "It Stopped Working" Diagnostic

**Symptom:** Was working, now broken

**Time: 5 minutes**

### Recent Changes Checklist
- [ ] Website updated/redesigned?
- [ ] Theme or plugin updated?
- [ ] Someone published GTM changes?
- [ ] New consent banner installed?
- [ ] Domain migrated/changed?
- [ ] SSL certificate renewed?

### Most Common "Stopped Working" Causes

**1. Theme Update Removed GTM Snippet**
- **Check:** View source, is GTM snippet present?
- **Fix:** Reinstall GTM via plugin or add to child theme

**2. Someone Published Broken GTM Changes**
- **Check:** GTM → Versions → View recent versions
- **Fix:** Click "..." → "Publish" on last working version (rollback)

**3. Consent Banner Now Blocking GTM**
- **Check:** Click "Accept All" - does tracking start working?
- **Fix:** Implement Consent Mode properly

**4. Ad Blocker/Privacy Extension Installed**
- **Check:** Test in Incognito mode (no extensions)
- **Fix:** Server-side GTM (can't fix for all users)

**5. GA4 Property Measurement ID Changed**
- **Check:** Compare GTM tag ID vs GA4 property ID
- **Fix:** Update GTM tag with correct ID

---

## Consent Mode Diagnostic

**Symptom:** Tracking works but data volume dropped significantly

**Time: 5 minutes**

### Check Current Consent State
```
1. Open DevTools → Console
2. Type: google_tag_manager['GTM-XXXXXX'].dataLayer.get('consent')
3. OR: Check GTM Preview → Consent tab
```

**Expected Values:**

```javascript
// Without user action (defaults):
{
  ad_storage: 'denied',
  analytics_storage: 'denied',
  ...
}

// After clicking "Accept All":
{
  ad_storage: 'granted',
  analytics_storage: 'granted',
  ...
}
```

### Common Consent Issues

**Issue: Consent Always Denied (Even After Clicking Accept)**
- **Diagnostic:** Click "Accept All" → Check consent state
- **If still denied:** Consent banner not properly integrated with GTM
- **Fix:** Update consent banner to push consent updates to dataLayer

**Issue: Tags Not Firing Without Consent**
- **Expected:** This is correct behavior IF tags require consent
- **Fix:** Either:
  1. Implement Consent Mode (tags fire in limited mode)
  2. Or remove consent requirements from tags (not recommended for production)

**Issue: Consent Mode Active But No Conversion Modeling**
- **Diagnostic:** Check GA4 property has >1,000 events/day with consent granted
- **Fix:** Wait 7 days for modeling, or increase consent grant rate
