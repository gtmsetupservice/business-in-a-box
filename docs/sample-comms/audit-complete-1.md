  failures. Your Google Ads account is now properly configured to capture and report conversions accurately.

  ## Problem Identification

  Upon engagement, Company XYZ was experiencing zero conversion reporting in their Google Ads account despite confirmed website activity and lead

  proper data flow to your Google Ads account.
