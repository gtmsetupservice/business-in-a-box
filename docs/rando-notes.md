  Test Proposal: Server Side GTM/OneTrust Job

  Hey [Client Name],

  Based on my 5+ years implementing server-side GTM with consent platforms, I've solved 
  this exact OneTrust handover issue causing 70% data loss multiple times. I recently
  diagnosed an identical problem where OneTrust was updating browser consent but failing to
   forward it through the client-to-server transport layer - the 20+ minute delay you
  mentioned is classic server container timeout behavior.

  My name is Bradley and I specialize in server-side tracking architecture. I have run a successful Wordpress Web Development Agency based on the trifecta of Ads, Landing Page, Analytics, I discovered that most consent integration failures
  happen at Layer 3 (transmission) - where events leave the client successfully but 70%
  never reach GA4 due to broken consent bridges.

  For OneTrust + sGTM consent handover issues, I implement a three-step solution:
  • Custom consent state forwarding from OneTrust groups to server container
  • Proper event deduplication between browser and server-side events• Real-time consent
  validation to eliminate the timeout delays

  I'd love to learn more about your specific setup. Is there a time this week you're free 
  for a quick 15-minute call?

  Thanks,
  [Name]

  PS: I just helped another client recover from this same 70% OneTrust data loss issue last
   month - happy to share the diagnostic approach that identified their consent bridge
  gaps.
