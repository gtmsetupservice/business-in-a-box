## Critical Insight from Video

**Video Quote:** "Momentum does not start when it's ready. It starts when you ship."

**Your Situation:** You have 90% of what you need. You're waiting for 100% perfection before launching.

**The Truth:** That last 10% is learned from real users, not from planning.

**Action:** Ship the site on Day 3 with 3 blog posts if needed. Add the other 5 posts by Day 7. The market will tell you what's missing.
