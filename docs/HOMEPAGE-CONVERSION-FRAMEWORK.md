# Homepage Conversion Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the 10-section psychological framework that converts website visitors into clients through a strategic emotional journey. Based on consumer behavior research and proven conversion optimization principles.

## Core Principles

### The 5-Second Rule
Visitors decide whether to stay or leave within 5 seconds of landing on your homepage. The #1 reason for abandonment is unclear messaging - not knowing what you do for them and how you make their life better.

### Emotion → Logic Sequence
According to Harvard professor Gerald Zaltman's consumer behavior research:
- 95% of buying decisions are made emotionally first
- Logic is then used to justify the emotional decision
- Your homepage must address both in the correct order

## The 10-Section Framework

### Section 1: Hero Section (Above the Fold)

**Purpose:** Capture attention and communicate value within 5 seconds

**Components:**
1. **Eyebrow Copy** - Call out your ideal client avatar (e.g., "For Overworked Business Owners")
2. **Headline** - Promise the desired outcome, not what you do (emotion-focused)
3. **Sub-headline** - Explain HOW you deliver + location for local businesses
4. **CTA Button** - Specific action like "Book Your Free Consultation" (not generic "Contact Us")
5. **Social Proof** - Customer photos or testimonial snippet with 5-star visual
6. **Hero Image** - Show the happy result, not the work process

**Mobile Considerations:**
- CTA button must stay above fold
- Shorter image height to reduce scrolling

### Section 2: Three Quick Wins

## Remember

This framework is about walking visitors through an emotional journey from stranger to buyer in 90 seconds of scrolling. Every section serves a psychological purpose in that journey. Never prioritize what you want to say over what they need to hear to take action.
