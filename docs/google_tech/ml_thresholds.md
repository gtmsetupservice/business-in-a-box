I need to search for current information about Google's data modeling thresholds, as this is a specific technical detail that may have changed over time.Now let me search for information about Google Ads conversion modeling thresholds.Based on my research, I can clarify the 1000 visitors threshold claim and distinguish between different types of Google modeling:

## The 1000 Daily Users Threshold: **Partially True**

### **GA4 Behavioral Modeling (Consent Mode):**
**YES** - The property has at least 1,000 daily users sending events with analytics_storage='granted' for at least 7 of the previous 28 days is required for GA4 behavioral modeling through Consent Mode.

However, it may take more than 7 days of meeting the data threshold within those 28 days to train the model successfully; however it's possible that even the additional data won't be sufficient for Analytics to train the model.

### **Google Ads Conversion Modeling:**
**NO** - There's no 1000 daily visitor requirement for Google Ads conversion modeling. Instead:

- You have a daily ad click threshold of 700 ad clicks over a 7 day period, per country and domain grouping for Consent Mode modeling in Google Ads
- Google recommends a minimum of 15 conversions in a two-week period, but ideally 30 conversions in a month for Smart Bidding strategies
- Google recommends having at least 30 conversions in the past 30 days before switching to Maximize Conversions

## Different Modeling Types & Thresholds

### **GA4 Data Thresholding (Privacy Protection):**
- Likely less than 50 users warrant the limit, with the threshold appearing to be somewhere between 35-40 users
- This is **privacy protection**, not modeling for data recovery

### **GA4 Behavioral Modeling (Data Recovery):**
- **1000 daily consented users** threshold for training ML models
- Uses machine learning to estimate user, session, and behavioral metrics to compensate for data not captured due to users declining consent

### **Google Ads Conversion Modeling:**
- **700 ad clicks over 7 days** threshold (not 1000 visitors)
- On average, conversion modeling through Consent Mode recovers more than 70% of ad-click-to-conversion journeys lost due to user cookie consent choices

### **Smart Bidding Optimization:**
- **30 conversions in 30 days** threshold for optimal performance
- Campaigns can still work below this threshold, but results may be slower

## Bottom Line

The "1000 visitors a day" threshold is **specifically true for GA4 behavioral modeling** to recover lost data from non-consented users. It's **not true for Google Ads conversion modeling**, which has different, lower thresholds based on ad clicks and conversions rather than total website visitors.

Most smaller websites won't qualify for GA4 behavioral modeling, but they can still benefit from Google Ads conversion modeling and Smart Bidding with much lower traffic requirements.
