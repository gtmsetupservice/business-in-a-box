Hi [Name],

Following up on the GTM diagnostic checklist - did you find what was causing the issue?

This week I helped 3 sites with variations of the same problem: [brief case study from blog]

If you're still troubleshooting, here are the most useful resources:

1. [Blog post 1 title + link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3 (7 days later):**
```
Subject: The real cost of delayed analytics fixes

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Is your GTM/GA4 issue fixed yet?

I ask because I worked with a client last month who waited 3 weeks to get help.

Cost of delay:
- $47K in unmeasured revenue (couldn't optimize what they couldn't see)
- $12K wasted ad spend (optimizing blind)
- Missed Black Friday ramp-up window

When they finally called for emergency help, we fixed it in 4 hours for $497.

I share this not to scare you, but because broken analytics has a real business cost that compounds daily.

If you're still stuck, let's fix it this week:
[Calendar booking link]

Or reply to this email with what you're seeing - I can usually point you in the right direction.

Best,
[Your Name]

### **1. Speed Over Perfection**
Don't polish the website for days. Launch with "good enough" and iterate based on real feedback.

### **2. AI is Your Assembly Line**
Use ChatGPT/Claude for first drafts of everything. You refine, don't create from scratch.

Blog posts showcase expertise without teaching your methods. Case studies, not tutorials.

### **4. Leverage Your Existing System**
All leads flow into your existing CRM and agent system. This is just a new top-of-funnel.

### **5. Measure What Matters**
Track inbound inquiries and closed deals, not just traffic. Quality over quantity.

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **1. Over-Engineering the Website**
Launch with 3 pages. Don't spend days on design. Ship it.

### **2. Tutorial-Style Blog Posts**
Your posts should demonstrate expertise, not replace you. Show results, not step-by-step methods.

### **3. Waiting for Perfect Content**
AI-generated content refined by you is 80% as good as hand-crafted and 10x faster. Ship it.

### **4. Ignoring the Email List**
The PDF download is your most valuable asset. Everyone who downloads is a warm lead.

### **5. Not Connecting to Existing System**
All new leads must flow into your CRM and agent workflow. Integration > isolation.

## ‚úÖ Go/No-Go Decision Points

### **End of Day 1:**
**MUST HAVE:** Website live with homepage, services, contact page
**If not done:** Work through the night or extend to Day 2 morning. This is foundation.

### **End of Day 2:**
**MUST HAVE:** 5 blog posts published
**If not done:** Publish 3 minimum. You can add 2 more in Week 2.

### **End of Day 3:**
**MUST HAVE:** LinkedIn posts scheduled, Reddit posts ready, email automation live
**If not done:** Launch anyway with what you have. You can distribute content manually for first week.

## üéÅ Your Unfair Advantage

**Most people launching a service business:**
- Don't have proven offer (you do: $10M ROI documented)
- Don't have delivery system (you do: 26 agents)
- Don't have clients yet (you do: Reddit prospecting works)
- Don't have case studies (you do: real client results)

**You just need:** The storefront. The front door. Public visibility.

**This 72-hour plan builds that front door.**

After that, your existing backend system takes over. You're not building a business from scratch - you're adding a marketing layer to a business that already works.

## What This Unlocks

**Before 72 hours:**
- Hidden expert
- 100% outbound sales (Reddit prospecting)
- No scalability (your time = only acquisition channel)
- No SEO/content presence

**After 72 hours:**
- Discoverable expert
- Inbound + outbound sales channels
- Scalable (content works 24/7)
- SEO foundation that compounds

**6 months from now:**
- Reddit prospecting = 50% of clients
- Inbound website/SEO = 30% of clients
- Referrals = 20% of clients
- Time spent prospecting reduced by 50%
- Revenue 2x current levels

**The 72 hours don't build the business. They unlock the business you already built.**

Go.
