**Service Model:**
- Daily Layer 1-4 GTM health checks
- Automated diagnostic reports
- Proactive issue detection
- Client alerts for critical problems
- Monthly summary reports
- Slack/email integration

**Technical Architecture:**
```python
# Scheduled execution via cron or cloud function
def daily_health_check(client_id):
    agent_options = {
        'system_prompt': 'GTM health monitoring agent',
        'current_working_directory': f'/clients/{client_id}',
        'mcp_servers': {'sequential_thinking': {...}}
    }

    result = query("Run Layer 1-4 diagnostic scan", options=agent_options)

    # Parse results
    issues = extract_issues(result)

    if issues.critical:
        send_alert(client_id, issues.critical)

    if issues.warnings:
        log_for_monthly_report(client_id, issues.warnings)

    # Track metrics
    sentry.track_execution(result.tokens, result.time)
```

**Client Deliverables:**
- Daily automated scans (background)
- Immediate alerts for critical issues
- Weekly summary email (if any warnings)
- Monthly comprehensive report
- Historical trend analysis

**Business Model:**

- High client retention (proactive value)
- Upsell opportunity (issues → project work)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Build health check agent configuration
2. Set up scheduled execution (cron/cloud function)
3. Create alerting system (email/Slack)
4. Design report templates
5. Build client dashboard (optional)
6. Test with pilot clients
7. Document onboarding process

**Effort:** 1-2 days initial build + ongoing refinement
**Priority:** HIGH (new recurring revenue stream with low ongoing effort)

### **6. Self-Improving Agent System**

**Concept:** Agents that enhance their own capabilities based on real-world usage

**Example Scenario:**
1. Client requests specific GTM functionality not in current toolkit
2. Agent recognizes capability gap
3. Agent searches for relevant MCP server or tool
4. Agent proposes configuration update
5. Upon approval, agent modifies own config file
6. New capability immediately available

**Practical Applications:**
- Discover and integrate new MCP servers
- Optimize system prompts based on outcomes
- Add tools as new use cases emerge
- Update diagnostic frameworks with new patterns
- Expand service offerings automatically

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start with manual review and approval
- Build pattern library of successful enhancements
- Gradually increase autonomy as patterns prove reliable
- Maintain audit log of all configuration changes

**Effort:** Ongoing experimentation
