# Proposal for Google Ad Manager and Google Tag Manager WordPress Position

**Subject:** WordPress GTM Expert - Fixed Tracking Issues for 50+ Sites

Hi Brett,

Thank you for the interview invitation! I specialize in **GTM implementations and WordPress performance optimization** for publishers. Your setup needs someone who understands **the technical complexities of GAM on WordPress** - that's exactly what I do.

**What I'll deliver:**

1. **GTM WordPress Integration** - Complete audit and optimization of your tag management setup for proper tracking
2. **GAM Technical Implementation** - Fix ad display issues, implement proper ad slot configuration, and optimize loading
3. **WordPress Performance Optimization** - Ensure ads don't slow down your site with lazy loading and proper caching
4. **Mailchimp Audience Data Integration** - Connect subscriber segments for better ad targeting capabilities

**Recent similar project:** Just completed GTM and ad optimization for a WordPress blog with 500K monthly visitors. We fixed their ad loading issues, implemented proper tracking for ad performance, and improved page speed by 40% while maintaining all ad revenue.

**Why this works for your business:**
- Fix technical issues that may be limiting your ad revenue
- Optimize ad loading to improve user experience and SEO
- WordPress-specific solutions that work with your theme
- Clear documentation for your team to maintain the setup

**Timeline:** Initial audit and implementation in 5-7 business days, with ongoing consultation as needed

**Investment:** $66.50/hour for approximately 10-12 hours, broken down as:
- GTM WordPress Integration: 2-3 hours ($133-$199.50)
- GAM Technical Implementation: 3-4 hours ($199.50-$266)
- WordPress Performance Optimization: 2-3 hours ($133-$199.50)
- Mailchimp Integration: 2-3 hours ($133-$199.50)
**Total: $665-$798**

My name is Bradley and I specialize in WordPress tracking architecture. I run a successful WordPress Web Development Agency built on the trifecta of Ads → Landing Page → Analytics. Through managing WordPress sites for 8 years, I discovered that most ad implementation issues stem from poor GTM configuration and WordPress conflicts that slow down both ads and site performance.

**My proven 4-step audit process:**
1. **Infrastructure Check** - Verify all scripts are loading correctly on your WordPress site
2. **Implementation Review** - Examine how your tags and ads are configured
3. **Transmission Testing** - Ensure data flows properly to all platforms
4. **Processing Validation** - Confirm everything reports accurately

After implementation, I use a **12-point validation checklist** to ensure every aspect of your setup works perfectly before handoff.

**Access needed for audit:**
- **Google Tag Manager:** Editor access (to review and implement changes)
- **Google Ad Manager:** Read access (to review ad configuration)
- **WordPress:** Admin or Editor role (to implement optimizations)
- **Google Analytics:** Viewer access (to verify tracking accuracy)
- **Mailchimp:** API key or admin access (for integration setup)

All work is done directly in your accounts - you maintain full ownership and control.

**Next step:** I can start with a comprehensive audit of your current GAM/GTM setup within 24 hours and provide a specific optimization roadmap. Would you like to begin this week?

Let me know if you have questions about the technical approach.

Best regards,
Bradley

**P.S.** - I noticed you've worked with several WordPress developers successfully. I follow a similar communication style - regular updates, clear explanations, and no technical jargon unless requested.
