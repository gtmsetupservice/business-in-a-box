# Interview Response for Google Ad Manager and Google Tag Manager WordPress Position

**Subject:** Re: Interview Invitation - Thank You!

Hi there,

Thank you so much for the interview invitation! I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to discuss your project.

I really appreciate you considering me for this role. I've been working with WordPress, GTM, and tracking implementations for many years, and I'm looking forward to learning more about your specific needs during our conversation.

**A bit about my background:**
- 8+ years working with WordPress sites and resolving tracking/performance issues
- Extensive experience with Google Tag Manager implementations
- Strong focus on making technical solutions work smoothly with WordPress
- Developed a 4-point audit method and 12-point validation checklist for GTM setups

I noticed you mentioned transitioning from an agency-managed setup and potentially working with multiple ad campaigns. I'd love to hear more about your current challenges and goals during the interview so I can better understand how I might be able to help.

**For our interview, I'm eager to discuss:**
- The specific pain points you're experiencing with your current setup
- Your priorities for the transition
- The scope of what you're looking to accomplish
- How I can best support your team

I'm available for an interview at your convenience and really looking forward to our conversation.

Thanks again for this opportunity!

Best regards,
Bradley

**P.S.** - If there's anything specific you'd like me to prepare or review before our interview, please let me know.
