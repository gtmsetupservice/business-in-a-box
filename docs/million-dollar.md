Based on Daniel Priestley's video, the **Multi-Million Dollar Lead Generation System** is an online assessment/quiz funnel that captures qualified leads. Here's what it consists of:

## The Core System (3 Parts)

**1. Landing Page**
- **Hook**: Either a frustration hook ("Feeling frustrated that X happens even though you do Y") or results hook ("Are you ready to achieve X?")
- **Value Proposition**: "Answer 15 questions to measure and improve 3 key areas"
- **Credibility**: Your bio, background, research/statistics
- **Call-to-Action**: Start quiz (3 minutes, free, immediate recommendations)
- Target: 20-40% of visitors start the quiz

**2. Questionnaire (15 Questions)**
- Contact info: Name, email (required), location (auto), phone (optional)
- 10 best practices questions: Yes/no questions about what they should be doing
- 5 qualifying questions:
  1. Current situation
  2. Desired outcome (next 90 days)
  3. Main obstacle
  4. Preferred solution type (implies budget)
  5. Open text box ("anything else we should know?")

**3. Dynamic Results Page**
- Score/visual result (speedometer, thermometer, etc.)
- 3 insights based on their answers
- Customized next steps (1-on-1 meeting for qualified leads, group event for mid-tier, content for unqualified)
- Contact information/social links

## Why It Works
- Captures detailed qualifying information before any sales conversation
- Different next steps based on lead quality
- Dashboard shows all lead data, scores, and recommended actions
- Works across agencies, software, coaching, consulting, education

Priestley promotes his tool ScoreApp.com for building these assessments.
