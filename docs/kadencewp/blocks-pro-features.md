## Status
**Page Analysis:** The official Kadence Blocks Pro page did not contain detailed feature information. The page appears to contain primarily technical/styling content without specific Pro feature details.

## Research Required
To properly document Kadence Blocks Pro capabilities, additional research is needed from:
- Official Kadence WP documentation portal
- Product demos or feature videos
- WordPress plugin repository details
- Direct contact with Kadence support

## Expected Pro Features (Common Pattern)
Based on typical WordPress Pro plugin patterns, Kadence Blocks Pro likely includes:
- Advanced blocks beyond the free version
- Enhanced styling and customization options
- Premium templates and layouts
- Additional integrations (forms, CRM, email marketing)
- Priority support
- Advanced animation and interaction options

## Impact on Four-Service Website Project
**Current Planning Strategy:**
- Proceed with documented free Kadence Blocks features
- Plan implementation using confirmed capabilities
- Research Pro features separately before purchase decision
- Evaluate Pro upgrade based on actual needs during development

## Next Steps for Documentation
1. Check official Kadence documentation site
2. Look for Pro feature comparison charts
3. Review video demos or tutorials
4. Contact Kadence sales for feature specifications
5. Evaluate free vs Pro decision based on confirmed capabilities

*Note: This documentation will be updated once accurate Pro feature information is obtained.*
