## Summary

The 15 GTM Architecture Patterns represent a major competitive advantage that isn't currently highlighted on the homepage. By positioning GTMSetupService as having a "pattern library" rather than just offering basic setup services, you:

1. **Elevate perceived value** - Enterprise-level solutions at SMB prices
2. **Demonstrate expertise** - 500+ hours of R&D proves deep knowledge
3. **Reduce risk perception** - "Proven patterns" vs. "custom development"
4. **Speed up sales cycle** - Tangible assets buyers can understand
5. **Justify premium pricing** - Intellectual property has inherent value

The pattern library transforms the service from "GTM setup" (commodity) to "GTM architecture deployment" (strategic asset).
